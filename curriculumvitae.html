      <P>
	I am B.Eng. Electronics with over 29 years professional programming experience over 20 as a Linux Kernel Developer. I enjoy Electronics &AMP Physics as well as programming. I like programming Android and in a GNU/Linux environment &AMP would particularly enjoy a job which appealed to my other interests too ( physics, electronics, VHDL Android, Gardening), I'm open to any job offers ideally near home in Mallow Co. Cork Ireland, or remote working, but, will seriously consider travel if a good offer is made.
      </P>
<P>
  I’m more interested in consulting and part time work from home and not interested in expensive cities as I’ve a house paid for and don’t need hotel & b&b lifestyle expenses or expensive small city apartment lifestyle, I enjoy farming part time to keep fit.

BCM1250 interrupt layer &AMP softirq improvements
</TD>
<TD>
Modified the sb1250 Linux interrupt layer to be fully SMP capable, interrupts in 
MIPS linux prior to my modifications  were always delivered to CPU0, 
this inadvertently meant that all networking code ( softirq ) code 
ran on only 1 CPU. I developed 2 policies deliver even IRQS to CPU0 
odd IRQS to CPU 1 or else deliver interrupts to both CPUs
( BCM1250 has two processors on one die ) while only handling on one
CPU ( hardware limitations on the BCM1250 interrupt controller
prevented me developing true floating irqs, this along with more
aggressive softirq scheduling vastly improved CPU intensive network
performance ( e.g. firewalling ).
