  <h1>fundamental</h1>
  I am going to concentrate latest development of fundamental from the github repository <a href="https://github.com/djbarrow/fundamental">here</a><br> I'm back on active development so expect tidy ups.<br>
<p>
This barely works beautifully but is my most original program to date.
I've recently found out that it uses a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression">Symbolic Regression</a>.
</p>
<p>
I read about genetic programming before inventing fundamental and I'm sure
i got inspired by wondering how data mining works.
My program is rough but almost identical in functionality to Eureqa
if I'm doing a bad job at explaining how fundamental works please watch <a href="http://formulize.nutonian.com/documentation/eureqa/">the following beautiful videos of Eureqa</a>. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/an-israeli-professor-s-eureqa-moment-1.410881">A Isralei professors Eureqa moment.</a>

Tony also has some code written but his <a href="https://github.com/verdverm">open source eureqa</a> seems too simple to be as mature as fundamental, it is designed for paralell processing something yet to be done in fundamental.
Tony also implemented
<a href="https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/proceedings/2013/GECCO/proceedings/p1021.pdf">PGE</a> but in python which means it would be slow.
   
One last link for reference <a href="https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-good-alternatives-to-Nutonian-Eureqa-Formulize-for-curve-fitting">Quora thread for alternatives to Eureqa</a>
</p>
<p>
Fundamental is a toolbox for finding relationships between
<ul>
<li> numbers, e.g. is there any relationship between the numbers
PI, e, the square root of 2?
</li>
<li> sequences of numbers, e.g. the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
It could replace/compliment this <a
href="http://oeis.org/">encylopedia of integer sequences (OEIS)</a> website.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It could have found the following formulas which started quantum
physics had it been around in the 1860's & 1890's.
<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/quantumzone/balmer.html">Balmer Series</a><br>
</p>
<p>
It could have found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck's Law</a> if on a supercomputer or used SETI at home's computer network.<br>
</p>
<p>
It could with some improvements in pattern matching have found Mendeleev's periodic table
of elements or did some of Murray Gell Mann's
work for which he got a Nobel Prize in 1969 for developing the Standard Model in Physics.
<p>
To date I've had little luck in coming up with a fast formula for
factorising large large numbers but God loves a tryer.
</p>
<p>
In short it's for hacking the laws of nature & mathematics
</p>
<p>
it is in some ways related to curve fitting ( or more percisely a program
for finding integer relations )
where you have some data & are looking for a formula to describe it,
curve fitting can usually be done by a human, fundamental
is more a brute force method where you tell fundamental what
operators are allowed + - x / bitwise and or etc.
The constants, e PI, it starts with the most simple sums &
progresses towards the more complex.
</p>
</li>
<p>
My original motivation for writing it was while reading
Max Borns book on the theory or relativity I fell over
a fantastic insight one of Maxwells equations.<br>
<p>
<center>
sqrt(permability of material*permittivity of material ) =
speed of light.</br>
</center>
</p>
 They didn't at the time know
that light was electromagnetic radiation. What I fell over was
that there were redundant constants of physics
& if a program mas made to search for interrelations
between the constants of physics on might by brute force
find redundancies, simplifications & potentially new laws of 
of physics, I was onto a winner which I knew I could pull off.
I had the first prototype of "Fundamental" laws of Physics
written in 36 hours around 300 lines of code.
It found existing laws of physics but no new ones.
</p>
<p>
It uses reverse polish notation (RPN) explained
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">here.</a>
The beauty of reverse polish notation is that there
is no need for brackets
the sum
2+3x2=8 or 10 depending on whether you interpret
the sum as
(2+3)x2 or 2+(3x2) reverse polish notation gets
us out of this bind because the order of the numbers
& operators gaurantees a unique & unambiguous algorithmic
way to do the sum. It also makes it very easy to sequence
or "count" through legal sums algorithmically & be gauranteed
that each sum is unique.<br>
e.g.<br>
2+3 is an illegal RPN sum as the + binary
operator needs 2 numbers to its left.<br>
2 3 + in RPN is equal to 5.
<p>
This is the beautiful idea which made funamental possible.
The only conditions you need to make in RPN to do any equation
is that there needs to be one less binary operator than numbers
in the equation. The first binary must have at least 2 numbers
to it's left A unary operatior has to have at least 1 number to its left
</p>
<p>
e.g.<br>
5 ! ! ! 2 3 + 5 + +
is a legal sum ! being the factorial unary operator.
</p>
<p>
Also the equations generated using RPN are easily countable.
e.g. it is easily algorithmically possible to write a program
for every possible RPN equation with constraints.
( an example of constraints are only numbers between 0 and 5 are allowed
& only the + & * operators are allowed * being the multiplication operator.
</p>
<p>
One of the thing I've had no success with fundamental is
finding a formula for the nth prime, primality testing
& pulling out the smallest or largest factor from
a very big number.
</p>
<p>
Fundamental is a step towards automatic algorithm generation.
I am very proud of Fundamental & have great hopes for it, 
it's by far my best idea to date,
</p>
<p>
It's open source & I hope someday it will help someone solve significant problems,
if it does please give me some credit for helping you on your way.
It may be of use in
Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics & Economics for Modeling data
without a known formula.
The program could be enhanced to do automatic algorithm
generation using an open source forth language engine like Paflof 
or else Java bytecode.
however it will be about 20 years before computation speeds
will make this possible.
Here is a description of what it how it works & what it currently does.
<p>
Fundamental internally uses reverse polish notation algorithm to search
a solution space for a formula given test data,
it can search for formulas for 
sequences of numbers as well as relationships between constants.
To date it was successfully able to find the following by a brute force 
solution space search for..
<br>
generate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor Series for e(x)</a>
<br>
An estimate formula for the nth prime.
<br>
Design an n bit adder using only boolean logic.
<br>

It could have found the formula for the Balmier lines in the hydrogen 
spectrum
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula">The Miraculous Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe Pi Algorithm</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein's_algorithm">Borweins Algorithm</a>
was found by a similar ( but fundamentally much different ) program.
<p>
<h2>Example</h2>
When set up properly you can enter a sequence like<br>
5,8,11,14,17 as follows<br>
fundamental -h 5 -m 5 -i 5 5 8 11 14 17<br>
Setting -h to 5 sets the maximum integer in the solution space to 5.<br>
Setting -m to 5 sets the stack depth or the maximum complexity of the
sum to 5 term.<br>

Setting -i to 5 tells fundamental that there are 5 terms following
which contain the sequence.<br>
The output of the testrun is:<br>
5 3 n[0]  *  +<br>
(5 + (3 * n[0]))<br>
5 -3 -n[0]  *  +<br>
(5 + (-3 * -n[0]))<br>
So the sequence formula is y=f(n[0])=5+(3 x n[0]), n[0] being an integer. <br>
<h2>Accolades & Delusions of Grandeur ;)</h2>
<h3>Pio a Friend and Fundamental</h3>
<p>
Pio is a bright guy, speaks 5 languages, Degree in numerical
computation & mathematics currently doing a hdip in cloud computing.
I've been 6 years trying to convince Pio that Fundamental was more
than curve fitting. After reading Carsten Otte's compliment he decided
he'd better investigate himself.
Now he's spouting things like GO FOR IT!!, Smart Cookie D.J., uv
cracked it this time D.J. Google can't help but buy it.
Now he is in disbelief that nothing like it has ever been done before.
Stuart Russell & <a href="http://norvig.com">Peter Norvig<a> in
Artificial Intelligence a modern approach hint that it can be done but
is totally impractical, my program proves otherwise.
Pio has agreed to write a fisher price web interface for fundamental
& explore data mining possibilities which he is learning in the cloud
computing course.... Thanks Pio.
</p>
<p>A colleage at Pace in West Yorkshire who knew Richard Feynman personally said Fundamental was bloody useful.
</p>
<p>
A colleague at IBM Boeblingen Carsten Otte had this to say...<br>
I browsed through the code of fundamental a bit.<br>
I find the idea brilliant, and I think this might be worth drilling deeper.<br>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrice_Bellard">Fabrice Bellard<a> didn't directly sing it's praises but here is what he'd to say</br>
Someone told me about a similar project some time ago and I find the idea interesting. Of course the problem is to limit the exponential growth of the search space. I guess that an exhaustive search cannot lead to very interesting discoveries because the programs are too small. But there may be ways to explore a subspace of the "interesting" possible programs with a well chosen language and search algorithm.
</p>
<p>
I guess that you already know the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_relation_algorithm">PSLQ
algorithm</a> <a href="http://arminstraub.com/files/pslq.pdf">( very
intersting pdf here on the topic )</a>used to find the BBP Pi formula
you mention. It just finds a linear combination with small integer
coefficients of constants giving a zero result. It is very limited but
already quite effective to find interesting relations.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly is only 2k lines of code.<br>
</p>
<p>
This is not curve fitting as defined by Wikipedia,
curve fitting can be done using pen & paper & it gauranteed to produce
an answer for the class of problems it solves, fundamental typically
does billions of calculations when used for curve fitting without
gaurantee of an answer & can handle classes of problems not handleable
by traditional curve fitting or Mathematica.
</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>
Yes the code is buggy if you aren't acquainted with the gdb debugger now is the time to get familiar, the code compiles using gcc & runs on Linux & possibly Cygwin for Windows.
</p>
<p>
The section of the code enabled loops ( e.g. needed to find the Taylor series expansion formula for e(x) ) by the MAX_NUM_LOOPVARS is hopelessly broken, don't use it & #ifdef it out, I'm currently rewriting fundamental so that it can develop code automatically for things like bubblesorts automatically rather than just the rather limited loop.
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
Fundamental now contains a Fundamental Overview.doc readme
explaining most of the internals of fundamental, please feel welcome
to send questions to me at dj_barrow@ariasoft.ie and I will add detail
to the document explaining your concern.
</p>
<h1>Travelsmart</h1>
A carpool website I developed finished in 2009 to version 1.0 available <a href="https://github.com/djbarrow/travelsmart">here on github.</a>
<p>
A nice young apprentice named Chuk from the U.S. is helping me maintain it.
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
travelsmart/htdocs/give_it_away_now.php,travelsmart/htdocs/templates/give_it_away_now.tpl<br>
in the tarball goes into more detail about travelsmart.  
Have a look at the Carpool Protocol.doc file<br>
It briefly explains how to get carpool websites to cooperate.<br>
</p>
<p>
Other open source carpool websites which could be merged with travelsmart are <a href="http://www.findbestopensource.com/tagged/carpooling">here</a>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Greedy carpool websites like Uber don't support carpool protocol<br>
so they can't share their carpools with other carpool websites<br>
They don't want to either and are using dirty tactics to put Lyft<br>
out of business like ringing up carpool drivers with non existent passengers.<br>
Other carpool websites get 30% of the drivers commission.<br>
While travelsmart allows any host to put up advertising for free on travelsmart<br>
Win win win win win............<br>

<h1>PCB-1.6.3</h1>
A pcb-1.6.3 patch is finally available <a href="gplcontributions/pcb-1.6.3.djb.patch">here.</a>
<p>
The patch has been tested against pcb-1.6.3 from Suse 6.3 only.
<h2>Improvements</h2>
The pcb-1.6.3 is finally suitable for SMT development.
<p>
A few new package definitions have been added including 
Common SMT components,PCI Board Templates, XCS40 FPGA,
Improvments to QFP definitions.
<p>
Made Soldermask Adjustable it was set to 15 Mils
this was impractical for SMT components as the primary
use of the soldermask is to prevent unwanted soldering
of tracks & pads together & as the space between components
on a PCI board is typically 4 mils this is too much.
This meant some modification to the Gerber & Postscript output.
<p>
Made gridding adjustable to 1 mil increments 
( 1 thousand'th of an inch ), this is required for SMT development.
<p>
Fixed one crashbug in insert.c owing to missing protype.
<p>
I am not the maintainer of this package so don't email me to complain,
However if I will give advise by email if the problem can be resolved quickly.
<p>
Read README_FILES/CHANGES &  README_FILES/DJBARROW_HINTS.TXT for more info.
<p>
PCI pin definitions were added for all variations of PCI, however,
minor improvments to pci.list & pci.inc still need to be done to deal with 3.3V & 64 bit PCI.
<p>
<h1>A FPGA Based PCI Board</h1>
The pci board designed with pcb-1.6.3 & my enhancements is
available <a href="gplcontributions/pcb.tgz">here.</a> 
This project is currently around halfway to completion it
uasesXilinx XCS40 FPGA ( Field programmable gate array,
essentially reconfigurable digital hardware )
& An Atmel FPGA configuration Memory
on the board so it
can be programmed to accelerate computation tasks
or emulate various pieces of hardware.
I gave up on the project as I was unable
to solder the 208 pin Xilinx chip as the pitch
between the pins is 0.75mm.
<a href="http://www.pcbpool.com">pcbpool</a>
are excellent at building prototype pcbs 
you are strongly advised to use them.
Contact me at my email address dj_barrow@ariasoft.ie if you want
to take this project further, the more intrest shown the
faster it goes up on my website.
I am hoping the project will ultimately go to
<a href="http://www.opencores.org">opencores</a>.
<h1>Boozy</h1>
Oh yes Boozy download <a href="./gplcontributions/boozy.zip">here</a>.<br>
A peice of personal DOS history from 1992, it's a SuperMario style
alcohol educational game ( which is so enjoyable it's an encouragement to sin ) about the adventures of a drunken horse Boozy and
Wild Bill Hiccup which runs some paralells with my own existance.<br>
It runs on DosBox DOS Emulator download <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1">here</a>.<br>
A low quality youtube video of the game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsuf-PlXO8">here</a>.
<h2>To install</h2>
Use pkzip,stuffit expander,winzip or unzip expand the boozy.zip file in
a directory specially created for boozy and take note where it is.<br>
In dosbox type<br>  
MOUNT [Drive-Letter] [Local-Directory containing boozy.exe]<br>
cd [Drive-Letter]<br>
boozy.exe<br>
More info on the Dosbox mount command available <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/MOUNT">here</a>.<br>
<h3>To run on your android phone</h3>
  Download DosBox & AndroZip from google play.<br>
  Download Boozy using the link above from your Chrome browser on your phone.<br>
  Start Androzip<br>
  boozy.zip typically installs in the Downloads directory<br>
  In Androzip create a boozy directory<br>
  extract boozy.zip there.<br>
  Start Dosbox<br>
  From DosBox type cd .\Downloads\boozy typically works if it doesn't<br>
  study the directory structure on your phone and play with the mount command described in the link above<br>

  switch on Joystick emulation in DosBox and play the game.<br>

<h1>Perfect Pitch</h1>
A Qt portaudio based mp3 to sheet music converter available <a href="./gplcontributions/perfect_pitch.kde.portaudio26022017.tgz">here</a> picture <a href="./perfect_pitch_screenshot.png">here</a>  the code is not clean and full of half cooked experiments,it works for guitar but not as well for
songs with drums & multiple instruments,<br>
Uses a original technique called resonance analysis which is more like
how the human ear works than fourier analysis.<br>
70% code complete.<br>
In 2009 when this was originally coded it was compeditive but now there
are better open source projects like <a href="http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/">sonic-visualiser</a>
and resonance analysis is not as good as the <a href="https://github.com/cannam/constant-q-cpp">constant q transform.</a>

<h1>Other projects I'm considering open sourcing</h1>
<h2>Voicetagger</h2>
An android app which can recognise voice recordings so blind<br>
people can make phone calls without a 3g connection for voice
recognition.<br>
Current state... voice tagger is 90% accurate with 5 voice tags<br>
UI done but voice recognition needs a major improvement<br>
I'll open source these when I get time.<br>
<h1>Licence</h1>
All the software unless otherwise stated is under GPL 2.1.<br>
But it would be great if you pay me what you think the software is worth, or better yet give me a job.<br>
