Foreword

\paragraph
\noindent
As Oscar Wilde once said ``Experience is the name people give
to their mistakes.'' \& I made plenty.
This book is as well as a Biography is a means to spread \& infect people 
with my memes ( ideas ) as Richard Dawkins writer of ``The Selfish Gene''
calls them, this book has really interesting insights into
survival tactics \& why death happens \& we are not immortal.
It also is a self help guide for nerds written to impart wisdom giving a 
atypical case study of how a nerd can end up in the psychiatric hospital.
The biography at the start of the book begins rather slowly so
bear with it.
\paragraph
\noindent
Probably the section of the book of most interest to nerds is
the chapter ``Streetlife the only life I know'' this contains
all my hard earned experience on strippers that I learned
from the school of hard knocks.
If you are a psychiatric doctor or interested in quantum physics,
The chapter on 
Theories of consciousness madness \& other things, section
Theory of consciousness determining reality
is the most groundbreaking in the book \& definitely for you.
In this section using generally accepted theories \& principles
of quantum mechanics I provide what I feel is strong evidence that 
individuals going high or mad go into alternate realities rather than it being 
``all in the head'' as most psychiatric doctors would have you believe,
more interestingly it offers evidence that there is a heaven \&
that timetravel is a rare but normal occurrence.
\paragraph
\noindent
Along with this it gives a ``Women are from Venus, Men are from Mars''
type account into the nerds psyche a very important insight for
women trying to understand nerds \& people suffering from mental
disorders. For a more complete \& sympathetic view on mental disorders
I strongly recommend Going Mad?.
It can be purchased from \url{http://www.amazon.com}.
\paragraph
\noindent
The open letters to say the least are ambitious if
the people they are directed to actually read them
I would be delighted.
The Random thoughts are thoughts I cannot elaborate
on a small few may contain nuggets of ``gold'' others
just contain ``fools gold'' ( especially some of the
fire \& brimstone stuff I wrote when high,
you'll recognise, it apologies about this )
if you find a nugget of gold
feel free on emailing me back at dj\_barrow@ariasoft.ie
with email subject nerds so I can filter the mail
with any thoughts you may have about what you read
so I can improve the book with your bias.
Publishers interested in publishing my book email
me with subject publishing.
Bookstores interested in selling my book email
me with subject orders.
\paragraph
\noindent
The ebook ( electronic Book ) version of this document can be 
distributed freely for non commercial purposes, email it on.
Pass the hardcopy of this book on to somebody who may need
it, another nerd or somebody who needs to understand a nerd.
The latest electronic version of it can always be downloaded from
\url{http://www.ariasoft.ie/ebooks.html}
I suspect the book will be a perpetual work in progress.
I am planning that 25\% of my profits from this book will be
going to GOAL an Irish charity which aids Africa \& another 25\% 
to Malteser a German charity which helps disaster victims.
Remember printing this book on an inkjet printer will
cost you more money than buying it, inkjets aren't cheap to
run, being a cheapskate will cost you.
However, I am finding out the hard way 
making \& distributing books these days is cutthroat,
I doubt if I can make a profit on this book unless I can
sell it in large quantities.

\chapter{Memoirs of madness}
\section{Beginning of the end}
\paragraph
\noindent
 It was April 2004 \& I was 35, in October 1998 I had left my home in Ireland \& had been working for IBM in Germany for most of 
the last 5 years. I no longer appreciated my fantastic job, apartment \& 
the party lifestyle I had in Stuttgart.
I was fed up, checkmated, in a cul de sac of life \& saw no way out. 
Stop the world I want to get off, in computer terms I had a Bus Error!,
It was reevaluation time,
I was spun out, traveling in ever decreasing circles. 
I was immature, self destructive \&
reckless no longer able to appreciate the 
fantastic nonstop party my lifestyle afforded me \& I
was about to let all the good bits go, I was unglued \& well into 
mental breakdown territory \& about to pop.
\paragraph
\noindent
As my cousin Dermot would say 
``In the long run nobody fools nobody'', 
Life is hard, nerds usually believe they have some incurable disease, they
think they are unfixable. God is wise if everybody dropped their
problems on the floor \& were asked to pick up somebody elses
problems they would take their own back.
Most of Gods 10 Commandments can be distilled to one Buddhist Thought,
``Find peace within yourself'', nerds you need to follow this advise.
If you write down your problems
\& share them, people will understand you better. Nobody except nerds
understand nerds \& it is my goal in this book to correct this.
\paragraph
\noindent
My insecurities began when I was about 3 years old. My sister Margo, my
sibling rival was a year younger than me, she was real daddies girl,
excellent at dealing with people \& animals, I was the jealous
insecure type who found that at 14 that I had better 
relationships with computers that with people.
No man is an island but for me sometimes life can be lonely
\& it sometimes has felt that way.
Incidentally my relationship with my brother James as we got older has
it's flaws as well, we don't fully understand each other.
From my perspective my brother James secretive, fairly sloppy \& leaves
a lot of stuff lying around the place, doesn't repair farm
machinery unless absolutely necessary but is very good with
animals \& children. Nerds are useless with children
they have no time for talking nonsense to them \& generally
behaving like a tellytubby no wonder kids stay stupid for so long
with stupid adults talking crap to them all the time.
  
\section{The Wonder Years}
\paragraph
\noindent
One of my first memories was of my father buying me a
red pedal Tractor when he was coming home from the
Dublin Horse Show in the RDS, he was disgusted when I showed far
more interest in the box it came in \& pulled my new box
around the yard absolutely delighted.
\paragraph
\noindent
I also remember getting ready for my first day at school,
I slept in my shirt \& tie so I wouldn't have to
put them on that morning.
Within a few months I was best friends with Shay Conway.
Shay was excellent at Gaelic football \& was a pleasure
to watch weaving in \& out between players \& obstacles
in the national school playground.
By first class we were at a typical male obsession...
comparing the size of our willies.
James my brother was born when I was 7 he used to cry when
people complimented mam on the beautiful girl.
When James was 6 he had a similar obsession with his
balls \& wanted those appendages cut off,
he should be thankful I talked him out of the idea.
\paragraph
\noindent
My sister Margo had the most sadistic streak
of the two of us, once she got some
food die \& put it in water \& told
James she had some lovely lemonade for him.
He proceeded to drink some of the tasteless liquid,
she then told him it was piss.
Another time she made orange ice cubes with mustard
in the middle \& gave them again to James,
she had a glass of clear vinegar on the sink
which she knew James would go for once he chewed
into the icecube, yes she was that bad!
\paragraph
\noindent
Margo also had a cat called Darkie which
had the habit of shitting under my bed.
Anyway this cat got flying lessons from me,
I threw it down the stairs, she sometimes
landed on her feet, sometimes not. I wrote a song about
``6 shits under the bed Darkie'', but forgot
most of the lyrics.
However bad the cat was I wasn't much better,
frequently while mam had visitors downstairs
I used piss out the window from my room upstairs.
My pee was clearly visible flying down from the
kitchen window below.
\paragraph
\noindent
At school I was a slow starter most people
were lightyears ahead of me.
Ciaran whom I met in St. Stephens could
do algebra at 3; I had problems with it at 14.
My cousin Margret could spell words larger than Cow at 4.
My cousin Anna at two \& a half was asking her
mother to explain the difference between today
\& tomorrow; a philosophical question;
At 5 I was a no hoper at elocution lessons.
My cousin Sarah was cheating at cards at 5.
\paragraph
\noindent
When I was 7 I had an immature argument with Dee our
workman at the time, about something I don't know
what, but for whatever reason Dee went ballistic
\& dragged me up \& down by the legs in the
garden through the nettles. I grew up about
3 years in 30 seconds, thanks Dee.
Dee was a nazi boy racer who had swastikas
on the halogen lights in the front of his Mini Cooper
which he drove like a lunatic while listening to 
Foster \& Allen on his 8 track tape recorder.
\paragraph
\noindent
Another time I decided I wanted to kill our
next door neighbor Mickey Bat with
a knitting needle, I ran at him, he
caught the needle \& bent it laughing.
I was disgusted \& ran home crying.
Mickey had a really hard life; his wife
\& son died when his wife was giving birth.
Another time Mickey hid behind the ditch \& threw
a bucket of water at myself \& Shay Conway.
We were disgusted as we heard him laugh ``Haw,Haw,Haw''.
\paragraph
\noindent
By the time I was 8 years old I was obsessed
with making catapults \& crossbows \& drawing spaceships.
I quickly acquired walkie talkies at Chairamee Horse Fair
from tinkers ( Irish gypsies ).
I also got a telescope \& chemistry set I loved trying
to make stink bombs \& was largely successful
in this endeavor.
Now Shay, myself \& Colm Murphy were ready to form 
KSP Killshannig secret police, Glantanes
answer to the A-Team. Needless to say
we didn't do much.
\paragraph
\noindent
At 10 I was obsessed with making jet engines
out of tin cans, who needs engineering skill
when you had a diagram in a World Book Encyclopedia
showing you a diagram of what the internals 
of a jet engine look like.
Shay \& I learned all the statistics of the
Space Race convinced that by learning this we knew
all about science. We had a long way to go.
Around this time Shay got a highly intelligent
sheepdog called Brack, who could keep up with
Shay on his racer going down a steep hill near
home, Shay was faster than the hound but
only just,Shay loved that dog.
I suspect he still cries about him.
\paragraph
\noindent
I have been trying to buy women since I was 7;
I tried to buy a pretty girlfriend with my Holy Communion Money,
chasing strippers is the next logical progression.
Mark my Karate trainer in Germany
told me he would sell his girlfriend
for a good guitar, I would trade with him anytime :-),
you meet plenty of weirdos in Karate.
Karate is great why anyone would play
a Karate computer game like Mortal Kombat
rather than doing it for real is beyond me.  
\paragraph
\noindent
As a child I loved fighting especially when I won; I bullied \& was
bullied, I remember chasing kids with a penknife
when I was 9. Another time when I was 10 I destroyed Majella
Murphy's dress by putting ink on her seat, I'm not exactly
proud of that.
When I was 10 I had a fight with Shay he threw me
on the ground \& fractured my nose. I unfortunately
discovered a side of Shay I didn't like. 
At that time of my accident,
his only concern was that I didn't tell the Headmaster.
I was to hold this grudge for a long time \& it eventually
resulted in us parting as friends in later life. 
\section{St. Colmans}
\paragraph
\noindent
St.Colmans boarding school most of the time was not a nice place; 
I was so stupid I volunteered to go there.
It was a place where parents locked up 300 problem
children for three weeks at a time, a place you got to see the
darker side of human nature.
When I was 13 I had a fight with a smaller guy than me,
Richard Tarrant, he quickly got me on the ground \& won
the fight; this loss made me wise up to myself that
I couldn't win all my fights \& I stopped doing it
until I discovered Karate.
\paragraph
\noindent
When I was 15 was where my life turned for the worse, 
I was kicked in the family jewels by my cousin for calling him 
his nickname ``JEEWWEELLIIIAH!''; on hindsight I should have 
realized I was dealing with a loaded gun pointed at my own head,
I pulled the trigger on myself. I should have demonstrated more self 
control \& kept my mouth shut.
I suppose my cousin must have had his own problems \& insecurities
to make him so short tempered.
This I now believe provoked a varicoseal
( a varicose vein cured by a simple operation ) attached to my left Testicle,
a little known
but a quite common ailment in men with tendencies towards varicose veins.
Both of my parents had varicose veins, what were they thinking when
they got married \& mixing up some bad genetics to make me?
It took me till I was 26 and 2 visits to STD clinics \& the humiliation of
being spotted by nosy cousins working there to figure out what
was wrong with me, had I somehow caught
an STD from handling animals at home on the farm?, I was too insecure to
point out my varicoseal to the people in the first clinic resulting
in the need for the second visit.
It took me till I was 26 to actually confirm that my problem was
related to my varicose veins which were starting to pop up at that time.
\paragraph
\noindent
I have a theory that there are only a small number of junctions 
in peoples life where decisions cause macroscopic life altering experiences.
Similar decisions made at these points may result in people having
similar experiences a partial reincarnation if you like,
history repeating itself.
I believe I had a similar reincarnation experience to Adolf Hitler 
who probably got  a similar kick in the nuts from a Jew
( sounds like Jewels \& Julia doesn't it ); it
is common knowledge he had problems with his Testicles \& this could have
insighted a hatred in poor Adolf to want eradicate Jews from the face 
of the Earth.
\paragraph
\noindent
Around this time Shay \& I were both extremely interested
in Noelle who was at the time my sister's best looking friend.
When my sister was out we bugged her room.
This involved putting a microphone behind my sister's bed \& wires
under the carpet leading to a tape recorder in my room.
As suspected she spilled the beans talking to my sister,
it turned out that she was interested in Shay.
I suppose Shay was the better entertainer \& didn't have
to deal with the being a beta male like me who
had to deal with various insecurities caused through
my lost fights \& by my recent kick in the nuts.
\paragraph
\noindent
Nerds, as Shay intuitively understood
women love to be entertained, do what pleases
them not what pleases yourself, be selfless while
trying to entertain them, ask yourself would you sing a woman
a Celine Dion or Brian Adams love song to them if they wanted to hear one?
Another common mistake that nerds make
is that women often don't want fixer nerds to fix
their problems, they just want to be listened to,
get emotional support, encouragement \& deal with
the problem themselves.
\paragraph
\noindent
In boarding school I first learned to program the Apple II a great machine
\& the Commodore 64 \& my most ambitious program at this time
was writing an interrupt driven music driver which played Axel F 
on the Commodore. I quickly became head of the Computer Room in Colmans.
When I was 14 I threw a big tantrum \& my mother give in \&
bought me the nerds beginners kit, a Sinclair Spectrum \& 
soon after I got an Amstrad CPC 464. I was a slow
starter on the computer John Rudden was away faster
but I caught up with him \& passed him out after 2 years.
John changed schools to Davis College in Mallow \&
didn't thrive as well there as he did in Colmans
from an educational standpoint.
Pat Shinnick was another friend he was very shy,
I will never forget the day we were walking around
the grounds in St. Colmans \& somebody coming down
the hill at full speed basically drove the front wheel
up Pat's arse, he also got quite good at computers
\& wrote a game of Frogger in machine code.
His brother John was the cocky member of the family
he was the best programmer I knew at the time \&
was able to do the Rubix Cube in around 30 seconds.
He went farming after the Enter Cert for 10 years
before going to college \& getting a Degree in Computers
from UL.
\paragraph
\noindent
At school one evening the group of us working in
the computer room decided it would be good if we could
arrange to doss study hours.
Our way to do this was to short a plug in the computer room in the hope
of blowing the main fusebox \& thus disabling all the lights in the
classrooms, all we succeeded in doing was blowing
the fuse which was connected to the seniors television set.
Needless to say we had to do a lot of bullshitting to
prevent us getting the shit clattered out of us.
My other dossing activity was going into the music rooms
to listen to good pianists play during study hours, I loved doing this.
\paragraph
\noindent
The most influential cultural event for me at that
time definitely was Live Aid; I watched it at Shay
Conway's house, it was absolutely brilliant.
The most interesting bit of body language I saw at
Live8 was John McEnroe the tennis player jumping
out of his skin wanting to play air guitar from
the corner with Slash from Guns'n Roses while he
was playing with the Sex Pistols or whatever his
new band's name is.
\section{University (or should I say Universities)}
\paragraph
\noindent
After boarding school I went to NIHE in Limerick
allegedly to study electronic engineering.
Thanks to my mother arranging grinds with Bill Shannon
I got an Honour in Maths, this
got me into university. The prior Christmas I
scored 10\% in the Honours Maths Exam.
However, owing to my immaturity \& my newfound freedom from
boarding school, excessively large classes in NIHE, none of the lecturers
got to know me or miss me when I didn't show up for
class. All I studied was video games \& drinking beer.
\paragraph
\noindent
My proudest boast from that time was
I once cycled home from a disco in the centre of Limerick
to the outskirts while drunk without putting my hands
on the handlebars of the bike. I got a new black \& gold racer while
in college \& like my cousin Dave when he was young, who spent half an hour
in the shower testing out his new waterproof Jacket
I was over eager to try my new bike out. I cycled
50 miles home in the dark \& pissing rain with no lights on a main road
with a ruck sack and a ghetto blaster inside, what was I thinking?
I was definitely in danger of removing my genes from the gene pool
\& winning a Darwin Award ( \url{http://www.darwinawards.com} for more info
on this topic ).
Anyway the bike being an object of desire was quickly stolen.
\paragraph
\noindent
On another occasion I bought ``shit in a can'' \& ``fart spray'' from a joke
shop \& put it onto an overhead projector in the main lecture
hall in NIHE. The lecturer wasn't too taken with what
looked \& smelled like a cows afterbirth on the projector.
He proceeded in trying to spoon it off with a sheet of
A4 paper, gave up \& called the janitor,
we got a free lecture, I felt guilty
but proud of this experience.
\paragraph
\noindent
As a result of not concentrating on my studies I got kicked 
out of NIHE at the end of first year with a QCA of 1.17 
I needed 2.0 to stay in NIHE.
As well as my partying I did have a few weaknesses,
I wasn't great at Maths despite having a love of the
subject, I am slow to pick up abstract concepts.
I believe I did good in the Digital Electronics
exam but I only got a pass mark, I asked the lecturer
Dr. McQuaid to recheck it I suspect he didn't bastard.
Around this time my mother died of cancer,
Mum Cogan \& Lena took over the job of making us dinner,
thanks, Mum's plum pudding \& sherry trifle are amazing,
she makes great Christmas dinners.
From there went on to study in the Cork RTC
now known as CIT Cork Institute of Technology, 
there the lecturers
got to know all the personalities in the smaller classes. I was much
happier there \& eventually got my degree in Electronic Engineering.
\section {Tears of Joy}
While in college Shay \& I teamed up with
Aidan O Halloran from Newmarket a singer friend of my cousin
Dave Barrow, John  \& Paul
Rudden also joined up to play in our band ``Tears of Joy'' largely a U2 cover
band \& owing to the Ruddens influence in the band's direction.
John played drums while Paul played Bass \& Shay played guitar
rather mediocrily.
\paragraph
\noindent 
I was the keyboard player \& had no sense of rhythm
whatsoever but was very good at getting a good sound out
of my keyboard setup, I personally was realistic \& had
no plans to go professional as a band as I knew I was better
in college, the Ruddens had other ideas however \& 
after Shay \& I left the band at their
peak had Ash play backing to them in Dublin \& played in a tent
in Feile in Thurles around the Summer of 94.
The band practiced every Sunday \& Shay occasionally 
shifted his new girlfriend in my dad's car. I was extremely jealous of 
him as I found her very attractive \& flirtatious which was
an extreme headwreck for a nervous nerd like me.
\paragraph
\noindent
Around this time I asked Shay Conway's carpenter brother
to make a wooden flight case for my keyboards, I had 3
but I wanted room for 5 digital piano sized keyboards.
I made out the dimensions 50 inches by 35 inches by 25.
John told me this was absolutely huge, I didn't believe him.
Anyway he made the box, it was about the size of a piano
\& weighed in at around 40Kg. At that moment I learned
what the consultants most dangerous weapon was,
``Give the customer exactly what he asks for.''.
\paragraph
\noindent
As anybody who ever played in a band
would testify ``Practice is hell.'' as this is where ego battles regarding 
the material being played \& the bands general direction happened \&
where the storms in a teacup arise.
Aidan being the singer had the biggest ego but wasn't a bitch,
he was easygoing.
Shay didn't pull his weight in the band \& I had
to collect him every week in my father's car, Shay often
wasn't ready \& we would arrive late to practice.
Playing on stage if a gig is going well is
far and away the best high you can ever experience,
well at least our single gig in the Hi-Land in Newmarket was. 
if you are a sadistic band member with a sense of humour start playing
bum notes on your instrument watch the rest of the band
wish the ground would swallow them up.
\paragraph
\noindent
As a band we were pretty bad but we won 750 pounds in a local talent
competition I think we were definitely the least talented
band which played. I think our rawness, enthusiasm 
owing to the fact we were jizzed up on adrenalin \& the fact we
were the local heroes won the competition for us.
Another interesting interaction which displayed my position as
a beta male in the group ( or at least the one between myself \& Shay )
that I will never forget is playing Summer of 69 in Fitzpatrick's
Shay kicked me in the ankle when he thought I went wrong,
Shay was the one playing the bum notes.
Around the time I finished college I picked up guitar,
I still play that instrument occasionally.
\paragraph
\noindent
Shay was a firm believer in the shortcut,
we had a lot of storms in our teacups,
he was an intelligent risk taker \& very witty
Shay at the time at least was lazy he once 
stayed 52 hours in bed because he could.
A typical interaction which got on my tits was
one time Shay passed a shop but couldn't be
arsed buying himself groceries,
when he saw me going towards
the shop he asked me to buy them for him \& gave
me the money, I didn't like being Shays gopher but
grudgingly agreed. I lost the change \& Shay
insisted I pay 5 pounds for the privilege of
buying him groceries, it was the interactions
like these that left a sour aftertaste in my mouth.
\section{Employment History}
\paragraph
\noindent
1991 was a bad year to come out of college, 
there were almost no jobs.
My first job I found advertised on the radio, 
I was fired after 6 weeks in MSD Europe in Monaghan,
a business set up by a ex calculator salesman,
they thought I couldn't program thankfully I have
since proved them wrong.
\paragraph
\noindent
After a few months job hunting \& soul searching
I started programming in PCSL Software 
( or as the employees knew it Poxy Cheap Software Ltd. )
around April of 1992 in Tallaght, Dublin.
I got my first job as a games programmer 
as a result of the games programming I did before I
went to university on my Amstrad CPC 464.
I really learned to program there from my boss
Michael my boss a qualified plumber, gas welder \&
a complete nutcase, we were well matched.
While there I programmed my masterpiece,
Boozy the alcoholic horse, a sad reflection of myself,
a Super Mario type platform game supposed to
educate kids about the dangers of Alcohol abuse.
Needless to say the managers wised up to themselves
\& didn't even bother marketing the game.
\paragraph
\noindent
Anton Wallace was the ``Aids Avenger'' game writer 
( yes another health education game ) who knew my habits one 
day as a prank when I went to the toilet inserted a bug in my code.
He knew I would go to the jacks again to pee \& think about
what caused my bug \& while there he changed the code
back so I would be left for a few days looking for
a non existent bug.
Antons alcoholic father was a very arrogant
impatient electronic engineer but a good seducer,
he once dated Sinead O'Connors sister, I
suspect the bitches were well matched.
When he gave up alcohol he turned into a fitness
nut like me.
Anton once told me that his father had recently
lost half his fingers to frostbite climbing
some mountain in the Himalayas it took me
5 years to figure out he wasn't bullshitting when
he brought it up again.
Anton is a fierce seducer bullshit artist like
Gerry Ryan \& has some illogical fears
like extreme fear of heights he won't cross
a bridge.
Great guitarist plays like Eddie Van Halen
but can't play Rhythm \& thinks that Joe Satriani
has poor articulation. He is a great cook
he learned from his mother who teaches home economics
\& a really caring friend, thanks.
Most of Anton's family like my own are quite
self destructive we get on like a house on fire.
When he got married his best man asked him
how long do you think this will last, it lasted
about 1 year, his wife one night refused him sex so
he decided to refuse her from then on.
\paragraph
\noindent
The bosses in PCSL eventually figured out
that developing games based on quiz shows in
Germany was bad idea \& we moved on to
developing route planning software like Microsoft's
Autoroute. This route planning software was quite successful but not
successful enough to make a profit as we had
60 employees employed in entering map data.
Rather than boring you further with details
of my programming exploits my CV is located at
\url{http://www.ariasoft.ie/curriculumvitae.html}.
\paragraph
\noindent
From PCSL I moved on to Apple Computers in Cork,
the experience was pretty uneventful aside
from writing some good code, making a few good friends \& developing
a hatred for the soap operas that the management
created there.Apple is infamous for its soap operas
it is where people go before joining real companies
read Infinite Loop for more Details \url{http://www.amazon.com}
thankfully the company has got better over the last few years.
While in Apple Shay's wedding in Mexico happened,
I didn't like Shay much at the time owing to other
fallings out we had. I was determined
that Shay's bad Karma was going to haunt him,
unfortunately my bad Karma 
for never forgiving him \& moving on in this
relationship was going to haunt me too,
I'm a stubborn edjit. 
From there I moved to IBM in Boeblingen
to develop Linux for S/390 \& LinuxPPC as a contractor.
which was nothing short of brilliant \& I have
to thank the management there for giving me
such an opportunity.
The more interesting hacks we accomplished there were
Doom running \& Window 95 running on Bochs
all running quite well on Linux for S/390.
Around August 2001 Shays father died,
Shay had aged a bit since the last time I saw him.
I suspect the stresses of Silicon Valley 
were getting to him a bit, despite this
he was the type of guy who would sing
the American national anthem for you,
I had no idea why he was so proud of America.
After the September 11th disaster Shay sent a
 message to just about everybody that he was okay,
he was around 3000 miles away from New York in Silicon Valley,
maybe he was unglued owing to his father's death \& fearing 
his own mortality, but I sent him a
scathing email telling him just what I thought
of his self absorption putting the last few nails
on the coffin of our friendship.
\paragraph
\noindent
I also had a 6 month stint in Galway developing
a firewall product for Asita Technologies aside
from drinking \& making good friends this was 
a pretty uneventful time. 

\chapter{Streetlife the only life I know}
What can I say most men like looking at pretty ladies,
my father is mad about them, so am I, I suppose you 
can't beat breeding.
As Horslips would say ``I'm the king of the faeries'',
let D.J. enjoy his amusing muses.
This chapter may challenge some peoples values.
If you are not interested in life on the wild side give
this chapter a skip.
The reason I love strippers
I need dishonest BS artist women in my bloodlines
, I am too f\#\#\#ing honest.

\section{Generalizations about strippers}
\paragraph
\noindent
``I've been the wild rover for many a year \& I spent
all my money on whiskey n beer'' .... \& the ladies.
Firstly the easiest way to get a strippers respect
you is to never go to a stripclub in the first place; 
that said this makes it very hard to meet them.
Contrary to popular belief strippers for the most part
don't bite, except at your wallet of course.
The easiest way to gain their disrespect is to
sit on the front row before the stage ``perverts row''
drooling at them while they are stripping.
Spending large amounts of money foolishly on them
will also put you into their ``sugar daddy'' box,
as soon as they consider you a serious source of income
it becomes quite difficult to earn their respect.
Self control \& moderation in spending money is key. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Contrary to popular belief strippers don't earn much
money, typically to buy them a drink costs the customer 
about \euro50 of this they get about 25\% of the price of
the drink into the hand ( about \euro12 ) 
the remainder goes to the drinks' manufacturer, 
the club \& taxes, for this
they have to listen to a lot of shit talk from men
\& pretend they like it.
Some sillier clubs don't offer possibilities
of the girls making money by buying them drink.
Strippers usually get most of their takings from private
strip shows; as a result they usually are far more
likely to want to give a show to you rather than
sit down \& have a drink with you even if the
drink is more expensive for you.
\paragraph
\noindent
Sometimes strippers boast about
the extremely good nights when they pull around
\euro600 but on average they only make around
as much as secretaries.
Some strippers allegedly get horny when you start
taking pictures with them \& acting hot yourself,
``Oh baby show us what you got, thats beautiful baby''
you get the idea, I have never tried this so I 
cannot confirm if it works.
The best nights to visit clubs is from
Monday to Wednesday, these are quiet nights
\& it may be easier to get time with your favourite
girls without much competition from other customers;
they have less reason to rush drinks to move onto the
next customer. Certain girls will only show up
Thursday to Saturday, the busiest nights \& 
some have other jobs for the rest of the week.
Strippers \& nerds are very similar in some ways \& in others 
completely different,  its a case of opposites attract.
Strippers like nerds are immature egomaniacs \& usually
have a self destructive streak \& usually abuse alcohol
\& occasionally drugs.
\paragraph
\noindent
Unlike nerds strippers are quite empathic \& can read people quite well
they are good talkers \& usually know about 6 languages;
computer programmers in contrast can speak about 6 computer
languages but have trouble with English.
Strippers are fierce flirts they make the chase interesting,
I usually get the crap scared out of me if a woman comes
on strong like I do, I think they must be barking mad,
I come on like a hungry wolf the women even strippers
usually eventually back off.
Strippers are freebirds quite irresponsible \& not punctual, 
if you manage to get their phone
number and arrange a date they will 90\% of the time be too lazy
or unreliable to turn up; 
if this happens don't lose control or abuse them you have noting to gain,
strippers hate immature men.
If you like them a much better bet is to go out for a meal
or a late night bar or restaurant after the show.
Strippers usually sleep till 5pm in the afternoon
\& spend hours washing their hair which is frequently
fake with extensions, filing their nails, going to
a sun studio to enhance their tan \& occasionally to the gym.
\paragraph
\noindent
At the club the girls are usually slow drinking their first drink,
if you buy them more drink easily they will usually take you as insecure,
easy money \& start drinking faster,
if you lose control this way they will usually disrespect you,
at this point stop buying drinks;
they won't suddenly start liking you for buying them more.
If you buy loads of drinks you probably expect something back,
the insecure male ego gets involved \& 
a storm in a teacup starts.
Respect yourself, don't buy a drink for a girl 
you don't really like or who doesn't really like you,
its a complete waste of money \& time, don't be a sucker.
\paragraph
\noindent
Ladies, you got to be cruel to be kind, 
you may crave male attention but it may
be time to gain some self respect. If you aren't
making as much money as the other girls because
you aren't as talented a dancer or as pretty 
as the rest of the ladies in the club it may
be worth your while reevaluate \& consider a career move
\& leave the girls who are best at the job do it,
consider a career in sales, nursing or 
secretarial work.
\paragraph
\noindent
Guys there are better places than strip clubs
to go looking for pretty girls, namely Karate or
dancing classes. Most of the girls in the club
who want a boyfriend have one if not a few \& they are almost
never customers.
Some of the remainder of the girls
without boyfriends are lesbian,
think about it, if you were a lesbian the
place is Heaven, pretty girls taking off
their clothes all night \& putting on a free sexy
show for you.
\paragraph
\noindent
Sometimes the girls tell you their problems. For example
Nicki from Brno in the Czech Republic was a girl
I really liked \& was one of the very few to actually
show up for a date.
I learned a lot from her about herself \& myself,
hanging around with her was a lesson a minute.
She really enjoyed stripping for men because
she knew how to please them \& I was no exception. 
On the date, I got under the impression she thought
of me as a potential ``sugar daddy'' \& she was 
like some other strippers a bit of a gold digger.
I bought her lunch at a beautiful cafe in Breunninger
shopping centre in Stuttgart one of my seriously
happy places we watched a couple of very good classical musicians.
\paragraph
\noindent
She showed me pictures of herself her father \& her sister.
I got the feeling that she wanted my interest in her Sister,
she started getting impatient.
She frowned at me when I gave some money to a beggar,
I suspect she felt that I should be encouraging him
to work rather than begging.
She then used McDonald's as a free public loo a
use Ronald McDonald never envisaged.
She finished the date quickly I suspect when I didn't offer
to pay for a new jeans for her.
\paragraph
\noindent
Nicki's sister had a computer programming nerd as a boyfriend
\& was one herself.
Nicki didn't understand him, all he thought about was work.
To get to know what kind of man he was I suggested that she either
seduce him or pick a fight with him to find
out whether he would be unfaithful to her sister or would hit a lady.
Nicki worked part time in Dusseldorf
as some form of agent for entertainers.
She got fed up of me when I wouldn't let her take
off my shirt when she was stripping off.
This was really interesting for me as I was more
ashamed of getting overweight from drink than I was
of my varicoseal attached to my left testicle.
My greatest shame now was self inflicted.
Eventually as with some other strippers I got
under the impression she was getting fed up with
me \& was only using me for money so I started
sending her texts that she was putting on weight
needless to say I gained nothing from my immaturity.  
\section{The places}
\paragraph
\noindent
I started going to stripbars shortly after I first arrived
in Germany in October 1998 I found flyers in local restaurants
\& couldn't resist the lure of the pretty ladies.
My four favourite stripbars in Stuttgart in order
are Winks, Macabu, Tahiti \& Moulin Rouge 
(apparently a franchise of the famous French Club in Paris.)
Most of the girls moved from club to club in Stuttgart
typically moving when they got fed up with their current environment
\paragraph
\noindent
Winks definitely was the most chaotic of all the clubs, my voodoo lounge,
the preferred place for me to study my new hobby, stripper social dynamics.
I can only thank Andreas the crazy Greek waiter for making it so chaotic.
He was the headwrecker1000000 model, if he only spoke English
he would probably say to me ``Your a long way from home,
welcome to the PleasureDome''.
Andreas knew how to deal with immature
egomaniac strippers \& made sure that you learned a lesson a minute in there.
Ellen was the first girl I met there, she was very honest for a stripper,
\& in a past life in the Netherlands was an amateur boxer, her mother
was divorced, she had a pretty hard life.
That night Lady Kim came on stage, Ellen wised me up to the show,
typically she would give some poor drunk German ``the crying game
experience'' Lady Kim was no lady but a chick with a dick.
After getting up close \& personal with a drunk customer Lady
Kim would drop his/her knickers the poor German caught on the night
would rush back to their seat headwrecked to sobriety in about
3 seconds. Another night an ``Elvis the pelvis'' character
went up on Stage with Lady Kim, he wasn't intimidated by the
climax of the show \& chased Lady Kim around the stage.
Another time his girlfriend an enthusiastic amateur stripper
did a show she wasn't too impressive the first night,
later that year she did another show it was obvious she had practiced,
professionals like Layla were jealous. 
I was told that Lady Kim was drunk she/it used to proposition
other girls backstage for sex.
\paragraph
\noindent
Another night a distinguished guest came in dressed in a suit
\& looked quite important I assumed he was the boss of some
large corporation later that night around 3am I saw him
dressed in a frilly negligee. I suppose when you have money
all kinky behavior is tolerated in these places.
Unusually enough lesbians \& straight girls used frequent the clubs,
\& there also were a few male strippers these usually were
ballet professionals from Russia \& to be honest put
on a damn good show.
\paragraph
\noindent
It was then I met Ebony, a highly intelligent level headed girl
originally from Surinam in South America who moved
to the Netherlands in later years, she was part Creole.
We became quickly became good friends, I used to love
singing with her, she had a fantastic voice, usually a duet doing 
Celine Dion songs Ivana a beautiful Polish girl used
love listening in at Tahiti \& it was obvious that the duet was taking
her to a happy place, my singing was absolutely
terrible but she used to love the performance. Beauty
is in the eye of the beholder.
Ivana was unusual, she was Polish, a heavy drinker, an animal lover 
\& typically was doing things like fixing birds broken wings, she practiced
a little witchcraft, loved
dancing, Shaina Twain \& Michael Jackson.
\paragraph
\noindent
One time my friend Fergal O' Connor came over to visit me
in Germany to forget the stress he was under at work.
I told him Tahiti was sometimes boring like mass,
he didn't believe me till he went in, he lasted about
2 minutes in there before he went out.
\paragraph
\noindent
The most interesting time I ever had in Tahiti was
when the Celtic soccer fans came over from Scotland,
there was a queue of them outside the door.
All considered they were a fairly well behaved group
of noisy lager louts. The body language of the
strippers was amazing all the girls except the ones
from Thailand were terrified, they were taking small
intimidated steps on stage rather than bustling around
full of vain confidence. They were delighted to see me
I was the only ``Gentleman'' pervert in there. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Ebony was nice enough to frequently drop me down Tequila or Pils
from the bar. She later temporarily got a job as a barmaid in the
Monument, an excellent disco frequented by people from
the Baltic states the most memorable band that
used to play there was called Viagra obviously they
chose their name before the drug became popular.
\paragraph
\noindent
Ebony \& I often went to eat at Samson restaurant after the show
\& one evening went to Delilah, I was feeling sorry for
myself \& started crying, I think this self absorption
put her off, if a girl asks a nerd how they
are feeling always say ``Great'' because a girl realizes
that this is how much you are enjoying their company,
if you say you are feeling ``Crap'' this means you really
think their company is crap. 
I also wasn't sexually attracted to many
black women... except Olympic sprinters, because
I am a racist pig, Ebony was excellent \& too honest for me.
I fell out with Ebony after losing my job at IBM the
first time around December 2001, I lost this job
because I was spun out,
I was a insecure egomaniac edjit fed up of wasting my
hard earned money at Tahiti.
\paragraph
\noindent
Ebony told me an urban legend about one stripper in Winks who
had her privates pierced why anybody would do that is beyond me.
Anyway she used give a particularly aggressive performance on
the stripper pole however as soon as she went backstage
she usually was screaming in agony you can guess why.
\paragraph
\noindent
Anne Marie was the worst female headwrecker I ever met,
she was half Italian \& half Romanian, a dangerous combination.
Her father was an Italian Physicist \& she was studying law.
One night in winks at 3:30am I wasted around \euro200 in about
10 minutes buying her drink \& a tabledance.
She just put her thighs outside mine
\& squeezed my nuts, everybody else was going home \& I was waving
to them like an idiot ``weyhey'', I knew the stripshow was going to be good,
after about 10 seconds she went home herself, I left educated,
it was good. 
\paragraph
\noindent
A girl who shall remain nameless was a stripper from Slovakia I met in Macabu,
she was typically good natured  until you got on the wrong side of her
( more on that later ). She was easygoing \& didn't go out of her way to
rip off punters for as much money as she could get. I regularly gave her 
leg massages which she enjoyed, after a massage one day claimed she was
going to see a professional to get a much better one when she 
went back to Slovakia, this got on my tits hmmmppphh.
She loved playing games on her Playstation especially Crash Bandikoot,
I told her I was an ex games programmer \& this interested her.
\paragraph
\noindent
As we got to know each other better she told me that
she felt her dead fathers presence at several times \& felt that
he was looking after her.
As we got to know each other better she started telling me
more personal stuff. 
One day she told me about a pain in her neck, I guess this was a cue
for me to be sensitive \& caring \& give her a neck massage or something,
at the time I wasn't going for it \& I suppose this pissed her off.
Another day she stripped for me I wasn't too impressed with the performance,
Like a typical nerd I showed her my phone hoping the games
would impress her, unfortunately it didn't, we both started getting irrational
argument, ``a bonfire of the vanities'' she was quickly
turning into Miss Piggy ( she does exist \& you don't want to cross her ) \& 
told me she wanted to look after endangered animals in Africa. 
I told her this was going against
nature \& to let it take its course \& later suggested that she look
after the pink elephants at home \& hoped I had a match made with my
brother James or my cousin Tom, she was having none of it.
My time came to a head with Miss Piggy when I slapped her on the face
in Champain night club \& she punched my on the nose \& ripped my shirt,
I went back to Macabu that night \& Esther repaired the shirt
with a paperclip a enjoyable night was had.
\paragraph
\noindent
Esther was crazy gymnast from Basil who ran up a 1500 Euro
phone bill calling her MOMMEE, she loved her MOMMEE.
She had a dog which frequently ate her cigarettes in an attempt to
get her to give them up.
She could oversplit to 220 degrees \& stick out her tongue at the same time,
this impressed me no end, she headwrecked me one day by telling me that
she made love with a customer at random after her boyfriend
dumped her, why this wasn't me I will never know but
it made me very jealous.
I was engaged Esther twice ( at least thought I was ) when I was cracking up.
I gave the torn T-shirt Esther fixed as a present to the 
anonymous girl with the words 
``Fuck me I'm Famous, I am MISS PIGGY'', she wasn't impressed.
I was high as a kite and possibly her father was getting really pissed
off with me from beyond the grave at this time more on that later.
Around this time I found the showcentre tahiti's website
\& the guestbook I did a brainfart dump on the website like
this book for the girls along with slightly more aggressive
stuff like ``Here piggy piggy piggy let me see your muppet puppet''
\& suggested that Ivana had an orgasm the last time she met me.
I was apparently upsetting the conservative sysadmins
on the tahiti website \& it filled up again with baloney
about how beautiful all the girls were, I suspect that
most of the guestbook was rubbish made up by the sysadmins.
Esther on our alleged engagement agreed to make love with me
doing somersaults on a trampoline,
what can I say I'm adventurous.
When high I told Esther I was a reincarnated Adolf Hitler,
she told me she was Jewish you can imagine what happened.
I am very stubborn \& patient I had to go mad before
I really wanted a woman, my offer wasn't a bluff,
I would like Break Dancing \& Gymnastic genes
in my bloodlines even if from a complete edjit like yourself,
I am the Sinatra Gangsta Disasta, Denis The Menace meep meep.
\paragraph
\indent
Roxanne from Macabu also got my leg massages, 
Layla from Winks was a mad soprano singer, she sung 
three octaves too high \& who often came close breaking all the glasses 
in the club.
Layla hated the indignation of stripping but put on a strange 
but interesting show nonetheless, she looked like a Bond girl.
I still have a picture of her somewhere.
I will never forget when she did a headstand on a customers
lap it doesn't take much imagination to figure out where
her ass ended up.
These crazy Romanians,Layla \& Roxy led me to the theory that all Romanians 
women flip flopped between loving \&  hating men, 
they had lesbian tendencies while in hate mode.
Roxy would always headwreck me by giving a terrible stripshow,
I bit her ass more than once \& it wasn't unusual for her to
touch herself while getting hot watching other girls dance,
there are a lot of funny places in peoples heads \&
like Madonna the pop star she knew all of them.
I frequently bought her perfume she bought me teddybears.
Roxy had several funny places in her head
one of them was a serious shoe fetish \& I used give her
stripper dollars for the other girls which she folded
up neatly into bows \& put them neatly inside the
straps on other girls shoes this put Roxy in her ``happy place''.
I invited her once to Cannister Wasen the Stuttgart 
Octoberfest she disappointed me by not showing up. 
\paragraph
\indent
Tahiti was more expensive \& certainly was not as much fun
as Winks, the main Guy in Tahiti keeping the show on the road
was a slightly dishonest but genuine conservative pervert who
had cameras behind the mirror in the mens toilets, Steve the D.J.
he spent a lot of time saving the egomaniac bitches in Tahiti from themselves.
The most memorable girls in Tahiti were the two Veronicas
One of them was from the Czech Republic she impressed me one
night by bending over backwards landing on one hand
\& coming up again. The other Veronica was from Poland
friendly but headwreckingly dishonest, she had a married
nearly identical twin sister who was married but replaced her occasionally
during a show to see what stripping was like needless
to say she didn't stay married long \& took up stripping too.
\paragraph
\indent
Macabu was a nice place with a terrible website
\url{http://www.macabu.de}
it would be well worth some nerds time
to fix the website up,
the main lady in there was an ex
stripper herself Sybilla Ott, I really enjoyed that place
\& made good friends with her.
One of my strongest memories of Macabu was of a
the Diana 1998 German rhythmic gymnastic champion
originally from Lapland her father was a Truckdriver. She gave a
great show, she was gyrating wildly with her leg
at about 160 degrees against the wall \& I commented
``that must be really hard'' from there she one leg
on the roof \& kept gyrating.
\paragraph
\indent
Moulin Rouge was run by a very nice lady who
had a son whom I reminded her of, she loved dogs.
My favourite girl there was of Katherina from Lithuania.
She reminded me of a girl I lusted after during my
teenage years but got nowhere with \& I spent 1500 DM in two nights
feeling \& eating her tits in the corner.
She was very easygoing, good company \& loved her family
\& opera, I once met her in town \& she was kind
enough to join me for an informal date.
\paragraph
\indent
I am back in Ireland again \& the nearest stripclub
is ``The Great Escape'' a nice intelligent Polish girl
there called Lucia who bought a Nissan Micra recently
invited my Father in, I will bring him there someday
\& his ex nun girlfriend Chrissie, I am sure she
will enjoy the lesbian show \& she can teach them
how to do proper Irish Dancing with the hands
down by their sides unlike Michael Flatley.

\section{Discovering myself from my dealings with strippers}
\paragraph
\noindent
I am typical tyrant computer nerd \& I know others,
for the most part utterly useless with dealing with women
who are not related to me.
I couldn't understand why they wouldn't do exactly what I wanted,
I could always get a computer to do what I wanted if I asked it
correctly, why weren't women more like computers?, thankfully
Karate fixed me in the head more on that later.
I had seen strippers, my strippers! I paid for them, 
like Catherine from Macabu run away into bed with posers she met 
in the local gym, ``this meant war baby'.
As my cousin Tom would say ``how many times do you want to
hop your head off a wall'' in my case it was pretty often.
In fairness to Catherine she was nice enough
to buy me a Tequila the one night she met me in Perkins Park. 
This ex beer guzzling fatboy decided 3 hours exercise a day 
was the way to go to beat the damn posers at their own game.
\paragraph
\noindent
All this exercise was making me lean n'mean unfortunately it was eating into 
my work hours, I sure as hell wasn't going to let it
affect my wine guzzling insomniac party lifestyle. I was now only clocking 
80 hours a month at work as opposed to previously usual 160.
I ignored the danger signs that I wasn't pleasing my current boss. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Like Richard Feynman the physicist, my Nobel Prize winning hero
\& the programmers who started Apple Computers who used to go down to 
the Pink Poodle strip club for dinner I loved my strippers.
I personally didn't want to lose my virginity to a Prostitute,
they had too much mileage on the clock. 
Partyboy had been made jealous, envious, headwrecked \& entertained into 
wasting a fortune over the past 5 years on strippers always 
hoping that if I bought them one more drink they would let me bed em.
The reason I wasted so much money is that I was spoilt \& my
parents never thought me the value of money, parents who are
working their butts of so that their children will have an
easy start in life are wasting their time, self destructive
people will behave logically only when they have no other choice,
rich parents you are only giving your children an awful lot of 
rope to hang themselves \& hang themselves they will. 
It took a long time to  occur to egoboy2000 ( me ) 
that strippers were mostly only using me for money.
\paragraph
\noindent
Deep down I want to get married \& have a normal lifestyle but in
all my years I had only met 2 or 3 women I fancied who actually fancied
me. I missed the window of opportunity on these occasions.
The one that affected me most was not picking up a tennis
ball dropped by a young female neighbour near home in Glantane
when I was 25, a real Charlie's Angel, the nerd in me measured
the distance to the ball \& she was nearer \& unfortunately
too young for my attention, my not picking
up the ball affected us both deeply, ``hell has no fury like
a Woman scorned''.
When high I wrote two letters to the mailing list
one that I had jackassed ( was ready for mating )
\& the rest of the nerds sitting in front of their
computers not interested in women were endurance
testing \& not ready for mating \& that strippers
were the family advertisers.
The second letter was directed at the Charlies
Angel who was getting married I was desperate
for her \& suggested I would buy the grooms
house \& wedding to her \& he wouldn't lose a penny.
\paragraph
\noindent
When high again I read on page 69 ( position 69 )
of the book Going Mad? I read an example
of Going Mad? where an overprotective mother
was calling the Charlies Angel of the same name
a ``prostitute'' for putting on makeup \& I remember her
shouting to another girl after the disco
in chapel lane ``you are nothing but a prostitute''
to another girl across the road the year before
this I took as an omen \& I thought
I saw her outside blarney wollen mills one
day but the girl spoke to me in German
she wasn't my Charlies Angel. I went down
to Bill Shannon my maths grinds teacher
\& put a Book on Wavelets on his car complain
that the Author was a ``Walnut'' ( that was the authors
name ) \& that I needed the teddybears version. 
I subsequently dropped
the Going Mad? book down to my  ``Charlies Angel's'' house
at 3am in the morning it wasn't read
\& was given back to my sister.
I met her father out walking a few
weeks later \& he gave me a lift,
thankfully we understood each other
\& all was forgiven.
\paragraph
\noindent
Like some nerds I spend a lot of time in a world of my own,
I am extremely absentminded, I am in good company however,
Albert Einstein, upto yesterday I though
my company was in extremely poor shape financially.
Owing to the bank not posting out balance sheets
for a company deposit account I have I completely
forgot about a large sum of money I had in the bank.
I once heard an anecdote about somebody calling
up a secretary in Princeton University looking for
Albert Einstein's address, the secretary said
``We are not allowed to give that kind of information
out.''. Then the caller said ``But I am Albert Einstein.'',
the space cadet forgot his own address.
I hope nobody cuts up my brain they have absolutely
nothing to find out who I am I just get inspired by God
like everybody else on the planet.
Einstein like myself was a simpleton who asked
himself the right questions \& did thought experiments
on them, it's easy anybody can do it.
He didn't even come up with most of the questions
the Danish guy Neils Bohr did.
\paragraph
\noindent
When I was first locked up in the psychiatric ward
in Burgerhospital Stuttgart I was diagnosed as having
``Hypomanic Episodes'' a kind of bipolar disorder.
This to the best of my knowledge wasn't caused by taking
illegal drugs, however I now know that drinking alcohol
causes me to go high \& mixes badly with my medication
Zyprexa as it overrides its breakdown in the liver.
Going high usually manifests itself as having feelings
of invincibility \& almost no judgment according
to my cousins \& nurses who witnessed me high. I
am almost impossible to argue with in this state.
I don't notice I am high.
When high every idea that comes into my head is
in my opinion at that time brilliant, although
with 20/20 hindsight I notice that most of them
are absolutely terrible.
This typically results in me doing things like matchmaking people who
don't want matches made for them \& sending texts
from my mobile phone which upset people.
Some madmen think that they get locked up because they are too
intelligent \& nobody understands them, this is generally
not the case, it sometimes like in my case because they are being
stupid \& challenging everybody elses values. 
As my cousin Denise said,
``It is not what you think it is how you act gets you locked up''. 
\paragraph
\noindent
My insecure ego was heavily involved with strippers \&
it took me a long time to see clearly see the reality 
that strippers are mostly players or actors, it is their job to satisfy
the fantasies of their customers, for the most part they
have very little emotional involvement with them;
it is not in their interest to gain any, it would fuck up their work. Some
strippers are unfortunately liars. For customers it isn't
worth their while to let their egos get involved
in the headwrecking games being played at stripjoints, all women disrespect men
who are not in control \& if you are wasting \euro500 a night
in these kinds of places you are immature \& insecure, you are not in control.
\section{Hospital \& my varicose veins}
\paragraph
\noindent
Around this time I went to my G.P.
who forwarded me to the surgeon in
Mallow general hospital he recommended that
I get my varicose veins done but not my varicoseal
unless I had problems having children.
My Grandfather had a varicoseal too so I suppose
I would have got one eventually even without the
kick in the nuts, it was genetic.
\paragraph
\noindent
I was quite jizzed up going for the operation
\& if you think strippers are kinky they are
nothing compared to the kinkier of nurses.
When I was getting my knock out drug before the operation a nurse
suspecting I wouldn't remember rubbed her privates
off my feet through her clothes just before
I went under, I suspect she didn't expect me to remember, I did.
\paragraph
\noindent
After the operation I was running around asking when is my
operation happening.
Like every night you go to sleep I believe I may have
died in an alternate reality on that operating table.
I got staples in my leg instead of stitches,
damn they were painful to remove.
\chapter{My attempts to crack RSA}
\paragraph
\noindent
RSA was offering upto \$500,000 to crack 2048 bit RSA
This has since dropped to \$200,000, they must be really
confident it can't be done, if it could the consequences
for the banking industry would be catastrophic.
the website is
\url{http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/challenges/factoring}
The problem is so easy to understand a 10 year old can
understand it, this implies to me that a clever 10 year old could
crack it.
\paragraph
\noindent
A prime number is a number only divisible by 1 \& itself.
RSA relies on the fact that there currently is no quick way to factorize large
numbers. An RSA key is made up of 2 primes multiplied
together typically 2048 bits or around 700 decimal digits long,
using current computers this takes about a guzzilion years to crack.
\paragraph
\noindent
To date I have wasted about 4 months of my spare time trying to crack RSA
\& on several occasions thought I was very close to doing
it. Philosophically the reason I couldn't crack
it that Prime numbers are truly atomic \& unbreakable.
Also I suspect that some Mathematicians \& Bankers
pray that RSA is uncrackable, I hope they stop praying.
DES \& AES are perfectly good encryption techniques
not crackable by a weakness in Maths. I have plenty
of friends who will make a lot of money from banks
once an announcement in security focus goes up that
RSA is cracked banks I suggest you start preparing now.
I put my attempts up on my website
at
\url{http://www.ariasoft.ie/gplcontributions.html}
for public consumption. If someone manages to crack it
based on my attempts please send me a percentage of the prize.
\paragraph
\noindent
If everybody trusted each other \& the world
was a better place there would be no need for
encryption algorithms like RSA.

\chapter{Prague}
\paragraph
\noindent
If reading about people behaving badly is not your thing
skip this chapter you aren't missing much.
During the time I was attempting to Crack RSA I
went on a very enjoyable cheap holiday with Anton Wallace to Prague,
it's a pity the town isn't as cheap as it once was.
Anton \& I had the most fantastic meals we ever had
for around \euro5 in the Pizza Colosseum the name
did not reflect how good the place actually was.
That said our shabby hotel at \euro80 a night was
a complete rip off. 
During this time I was a complete egomaniac convinced
I was days away from cracking RSA.
\paragraph
\noindent
My most enjoyable experience in Prague was completely free
I was walking down Wenslas street \& was being propositioned
by various good looking ladies for sexual favours,
I was convinced that I would be mugged if I went with
any of these ladies so I declined them all.
I got such an ego boost by the time I was at
the bottom of the street I had to go back up
the street \& decline them all again
\paragraph
\noindent
Karlovy Lanze near Charles Bridge was definitely
the best disco in Prague one night we were
watching two characters there. An egomaniac
Woman \& an Army Guy. The Woman from the way
she was dancing was very sure of how fantastic
she was. Anyway the soldier got out of his clothes
\& danced balls naked in front of her, he won.
\paragraph
\noindent
If you are easily disgusted I suggest you give this paragraph a skip.
It was in Prague that I had my worst but most educational
experience with a stripper ever, I went to a club called Goldfingers.
I got a private dance \& bit a stripper on the ass.
After the dance I noticed the front of my shirt
was slightly wet. To this day I still don't know whether
I drooled on the shirt of the stripper after
being bit on the backside had her revenge on me
by peeing on the front of the shirt,
if she did she had fantastic self control to get away with it.
\chapter{A Russian Romance}
\paragraph
\noindent
Around August/September of 2002, I was considering Women
from the Eastern Block my first experience was
of a girl allegedly known as Evegenia.
I found her on
\url{http://www.kiss.com}
I noticed a lot of advertisements on this website were put
there by men who were mugged as warnings to other
people when they went to visit the alleged girl.
Some of the advertisements were photographs of a pretty models
with bullshit life stories
put up by a Russian mugger or similar.
I got suspicious of Evegenia eventually \& had
to call a halt to this.
\paragraph
\noindent
I eventually found Nick in the U.K.
whose wife was from Odessa in the Ukraine who
for a fee sent a friend in Odessa to
give the alleged girl flowers to check
was she genuine. My  girl this time
was Olga who I found on
\url{http://www.angelika.net}
I highly recommend this site
\& unfortunately Nick is no longer providing a 
service to find out if the girls are
genuine.
\paragraph
\noindent
Getting a visa from the Ukrainian Embassy
I found out the hard way was a complete waste of
time. The only way to go is use a travel
agent who specializes in travel to the Ukraine
\& let them arrange the visa.
\paragraph
\noindent
The Ukraine is very poor, poorer than Russia \& while there
I noticed more people looking for
food out of dumpsters than putting rubbish in.
I found the people there very friendly \&
the cooperate with each other much more than in
Europe because they have to.
Being picked up while hitchhiking is very common
\& you usually give a tip to the person
giving the lift or negotiate on a price beforehand.
Ireland now that the economy is booming is
getting emotionally cold like Germany in the
70's this is because everybody has enough
money to be independent \& nobody needs friends or
to trust anybody anymore, it is so stupid.
The Polish \& Lithuanian migrant workers
in Ireland are not doing much for the
economy \& it is fair enough, they will
purchase their houses at home because
the houses here are so overpriced.
Most of them have university degrees \&
they are working as farm labourers
\& in shops, no Irish person will do
these jobs anymore even though
they are less educated it's a funny world. 
\paragraph
\noindent
The establishment is very corrupt in Ukraine,
Some Banks are run by the Mafia, frequently claim
bankruptcy \& run away with the money.
Olga's parents got their life savings stolen
from them.
The only way to send money to the Ukraine
is by Western Union \& they charge a huge commission.
If you post money there it will usually be stolen.
The Mafia are the nice guys in the Ukraine, the
Police will mug you, likewise the politicians.
\paragraph
\noindent
I made good friends with Olga, but there was no spark
of Romance.
We went to excellent restaurants in the Ukraine \& went
to visit Olga's friends \& parents who were excellent
With the exception of Olga's father who was very lazy.
Olga was afraid to leave the Ukraine because
she had to look after her mother.
Olga was manipulated a lot by men \& had
difficulty trusting them. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Hotels in Ukraine charge Westerners
about 3 times as much as they charge Russians because they can,
usually are fairly cheap \& tacky, you've been warned.

\chapter{Sigue Sigue Sputnik Baby}
\paragraph
\noindent
 Perkins Park Stuttgart is where all the serious sexmachines hung out
it was there I ran into Cosmo ( aka Turkish Elvis ) 
\& Fabio the Hollywood Dancers
\url{http://www.hollywooddancers.net}
these Guys knew how to party.
Cosmo had gained notoriety on Germany's search for
a star TV program for dropping his pants \& showing off his goods.
Fabio turned up for the second round of the competition after
disbelieving he didn't make it past the first round \& cried his eyes out
on German TV, he was told that he couldn't sing to save his life.
\paragraph
\noindent
These Guys were larger than life \& had a serious lust for it,
it was obvious to me they were going to make it big one way or the other,
Cosmo was a natural showman \& expert in social dynamics could make
an edjit out of anyone by jackassing the insecure egomaniac 
that exists in most of us.
He usually started the circus at Perkins on Sunday night at 2am 
with a taunt like ``you can't dance for shit baby'' 
next thing all the break dancers came out of the woodwork.
One time Ebru a Turkish lady bartender put her hand to her nose 
\& waved Cosmo off
implying that he stinked, next week he was ready for her, he jiggled
his ass \& Magic Johnsoned his underpants off without taking down his pants
\& threw it at her. Another time in Perkins he was making a paper flower
for a girl \& looked like he was doing a good job at it, the girl was pleased,
next thing he turned around \& started eating it \& then walked off, it took
me 20 minutes to figure out it was a joke.
\paragraph
\noindent
Cosmo was fit \& I had been benchmarking my fitness against 
him for the last year.
He had a Russian girlfriend who spurted water from her 
mouth on my chest one evening at
the disco, I was delighted with the attention;
it is amazing the kinds of attention nerds shouldn't enjoy which you just do.
Now things were coming to a head, I was being seduced down Cosmos merry
path. There was a stripper pole in Perkins \& I was practicing on it.
That Sunday Cosmo \& Fabio were there \& Fabio was on the pole,
this was my big chance to perform, I was completely jizzed out
on adrenalin. Jumped on the pole \& screamed ``SHOWTIME'', next thing
I knew I was thinking this didn't hurt so much the last time \& I
could have sworn I heard my neck cracking :-O, was I dead? was Cosmo
my Grim Reaper?, dear God he sure looked like one. I had no memory
of the rest of that night but I woke up that morning with a
bandage put on by Sali a nice Turkish barman from Perkins \& found
my pants soiled so badly it took 5 washes with a nailbrush to get
the stains out, I broke my hole laughing it was a fantastic
release of the frustration I was having at work \& I was now
completely seduced into becoming a Partyboy, work
was going to take a back seat for a while, I went into work that day at 4PM. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Boa Discotech Stuttgart is the place to be on Monday night all the Stuttgart
bartenders were out on their free night, Body Builders,
 Greek chicks with dicks \& 
other weirdos who danced in their underpants 
\& hung out there, it was fun fun fun.
\paragraph
\noindent
The night after the accident I met Cosmo to Boa \& had a good
talk with him \& we made friends I followed him to his show at Sinatra Bar
in Rotebuhlplatz Stuttgart.
At 4am in the morning Sinatra bar the party continues till 6am,
it frequently is so busy on Monday you can't get in, it is unreal.
That night Cosmo is dancing on stage doing his Emenem gangsta disasta rap
in his bozo the clowns outfit on the bar, party women were doing their
Coyote ugly routine, that night there were Thai girls tearing \&
fighting like terriers
off each end of Cosmos underpants with their teeth 
his ass jiggling all in all it was fantastic fun.
I also was busy making friends with Cosmos sister \& putting Fabio's
hand on the ass of a stripper shaking baby electricity flowing 
I knew she wasn't impressed.
\section {The Karate Kid, Wax on Wax off}
\paragraph
\noindent
The following day was my Shokotan Karate class
\url{http://www.ukd-stuttgart.de}
This is where every headwrecked nerd should go instead of wasting their money 
on strippers, the girls are fit, usually good looking \& intelligent
as a bonus some can do the splits as well, as an additional bonus you get 
fit, learn to understand people by losing fear in freefights, cooperating 
with people to get fit instead of trying to control them in order to get fit.
You gain some self respect too, all this for \euro70 a year amazing :-),
unfortunately back in Ireland lessons cost typically \euro5 a lesson,
this is because the people fighting don't trust each other 
( insurance \& ambulance chasers ) this is in the wrong place in the head
for good Karate.
\paragraph
\noindent
Any team sport is good for nerds, I enjoyed fighting as a child
\& this is why I enjoy Karate, nerds what did you enjoy doing 
as a child, anything?,
if possible relive it. There are other fixers, skydiving
is extremely good for gaining confidence but nerds need sports
which involve other people or animals, like horse riding, you
can't control a horse only cooperate with it, it is completely
different from driving a motorbike, cooperation is key to fixing
nerds, I can't stress this enough, Swimming \& playing an instrument
( preferably Guitar ) are also good pastimes for nerds,
however, don't go into the deep end in the pool unless you can
breathe properly or you want mouth to mouth from a pretty lifeguard.
\section {Call on me Valerie}
\paragraph
\noindent
My experience got weirder that Tuesday night, I met Alex a Karate green belt 
in free fight God she was gorgeous.
She obviously had some issues, \& wanted to take them out on a man, on
this occasion it was me. Like an angry catwoman she came at me from
all angles fighting me at full speed \& kicking me quickly but
not hard on the head. I was reversing at full speed screaming ``OH GOD''
trying with all my might not to be jackassed into hitting her
a hard clatter back or rugby tackling her.
I had a severe headache after the fight, I tried making dates
with her but couldn't, I asked her awkwardly \& she didn't 
want a man with a lack of self confidence, she evaded me after Karate practice.
I believe the headache I had after the fight gave me Xen Buddhist
Enlightenment ( I could be wrong ) but it affected my outlook
on life \& started off my madness which led me to the psychiatric hospital.
I started writing emails \& mobile phone texts that I was going to be married
soon, I had no idea to whom all I knew was I was going to be married soon.
I didn't realize it at the time but I was getting seriously unglued 
I even asked Sali from Perkins to invite Bin Laden to my wedding.
I didn't even consider what a fundamentalist would think of
the hedonist party wedding I was going to have, if he came
we were all likely to be shot.
\paragraph
\noindent
A few weeks later Alex picked me up on the way to Karate
she started talking about happy hours \& I began thinking I would
really like happy hours with her.
A few weeks later I noticed Alex's name on the my Karate jumpsuit
\& pointed out to the trainer Mark that I must belong to Alex,
at the time he was impressed by the significance of this \& went with it.
\paragraph
\noindent
I started emailing Alex through the Karate mailing list with
messages for Alex like ``for happy hours call me'' however some of
them were really stupid with subjects like ``Hitler is roaring''
\& I was promptly banned from the mailing list.
\paragraph
\noindent
I was getting unglued I had lost my job at IBM on April fools day
\& was not feeling like a fool not yet at least.
I was emailing the Linux Kernel mailing list telling them
I had jackassed \& sent another email to the IBM establishment
that they were all jackass sexmachines.
I was a classic manic depressive \& told Cosmo I
was the third smartest guy on the planet,
was about to win a Nobel Prize \& sent
him several texts which apparently got him into a
lot of trouble more than likely with a woman
I was trying to set him up with in Hermes Restaurant,
Cosmo with his spiderman vest showing off his body
wouldn't have got on too well with the Greek waiters
his last text to me was ``FUCK YOU FOR EVER'',
he always did everything in capitals.
When I was high for the third time I tried to
contact Cosmo to get him to sing for my Thin Lizzy
tribute band while in the jacks in Cork I saw an omen,
``Elvis says get a life'', I feel that is what Cosmo
was saying to me at the time when I couldn't contact him.
My landlady a few months earlier sent me a prudish letter
that she was worrying about my health \& my lifestyle \&
suggested I see a counsellor. Shortly after losing my job I
suggested to my nice old neighbors the Shopfs downstairs from my
apartment that they should take
up Karate \& even roared at them, when they handed back the
Ginhin Funakoshi ``Karate Do My Way of Life'' book to me about an
89 year old who had
popularized Shokotan Karate in the west if he could practice it
at 89 why couldn't they at a mere 75.
\paragraph
\noindent
I phoned my friend Pio O Connell \& told him that
Padre Pio was a very holy man with very holey hands
\& was driving nails in them every night this blasphemy
is probably why God took me to the psychiatric hospital, more about that later.
\paragraph
\noindent
Around this time I went into Da Vinci's a lovely Italian restaurant
near Schlossplatz \& because I was high I was acting like
I knew something special \& the waiters were interested in
my unusual behavior; eventually I spilled the beans that
``I was Buddah \& they made it to Xen Buddhist Heaven'', one of the waiters
bought this line of bullshit \& because there was a festival
in Stuttgart at the time went like a lunatic to tell everybody.
After spreading the good news I walked out without paying for
the meal, you don't have to pay for anything in Heaven.
A few days later I walked in \& got all of their business
cards \& started dropping them around the Boerse ( the stock exchange )
where I am sure that in a past life as Adolf Hitler I made
a few speeches, at the centre of Schlossplatz there is an Eagle
on a high perch \& another omen a piece of modern art
a colourful Broken Arrow B(arrow) pointing at it.
I was dropping the business cards away expecting passers
by to pick them up with the waiters from Da Vinci's
waiters following this oddball who felt he never had
to pay for a meal again.
\paragraph
\noindent
Around this time I found a fantastic park up near
Perkins Park disco \& it had a lovely metal tower for
viewing the city there, being a reincarnated Hitler
I thought of this as an Eagles Nest.
There is a place near home called Nadd whose full name in English
is ``The Eagles Nest'' on my reincarnation theme 
one of Hitlers favourite hangouts \& one of mine.
I was well \& truly away with the faeries at this time
\& felt it was the role of some people whom I considered
'pigeons'' to lock up ``catwomen'' specially for me in toilets.
So I proceeded to check whether some of the waiter ``pigeons''
in the lovely park had locked up Alex my ``catwoman''
Karate girl for me in the ladies toilets in the
park, I also checked the toilets down at Breunninger 
shopping centre where
I believed Alex would somehow psychically know
that I had meant to meet her there.
To let the waiters know I was a Hitler I took
a glass of apfelschorle meant for someone else
\& drunk it, a well built waiter got upset with me \&
to prove I wasn't somebody to be trifled with
I left a tip of \euro50. Being Hitler
I also expected to be served automatically
when I sat down in Perkins Park disco.
\paragraph
\noindent
Around this time I left Sandro the local hairdresser
who own Cut Arts near my apartment most of my books
\& told him it was his jobs to sort out the good
guys from the bad guys in a ``Highway to Heaven'' Style.
The bad guys would be
the me me me egomaniacs who liked looking at themselves \& read the Yoga
books a lot of which involves self observation. The good
guys would be reading the you you you Karate books because they
observe everybody else while practicing Karate.
Sandro told me he was at one time the heavyweight
champion boxer of the Baden-Wuttenberg area.
I thought that Sandro \& Cosmo would be ideal
to help Saddam Hussein breakout in Jackass style under
observation of the cameras in the court from the witchhunt
trial being done by George W. Bush in Iraq
( I am not saying that Saddam is a good man but
even George W. must be the only leader in the
history of the planet to start a major war over oil. ).
Anyway Cosmo \& Sandro eventually figured out I was
as mad as a hatter \& weren't having much to do with
me after that.
\paragraph
\noindent
After that I went into Biddie Earlie's wearing a Linux for S/390
tee shirt \& explained to them that the S/390 on the back
of the shirt was symbolic of me moving on from programming
Linux for S/390 from IBM \& that I was a white angel.
After getting impatient about
not getting Steve's phone number I jumped behind the bar \&
started writing my I am a reincarnated Hitler rant \&
was kicked in the nuts by some edjits like them \&
they had to get control of all the bouncers in Stuttgart
who kick people in the nuts or Hitler might kill them.
Needless to say I got barred from Biddies as well.
While exercising in the Local Childrens playground
where I got fit I noticed rats looking at me in disgust.
I took that to be an omen of the rats in Biddies
getting control of the bouncer rats in Stuttgart.
\paragraph
\noindent
Around this time  I showed a barmaid a video of my brother
James I had on my phone \& asked her what she thought she said ``nice'',
I thought I had a match made for my brother. A few days later
in the night I ran into Delilah while jogging in my shorts showing
off what a fine thing I was \& gave her a weird letter telling
her all about her brother being a reincarnated Samson working
in Delilah \& that my sister's boyfriend's
last name was Sampson. I went behind the bar to get her attention
but I wigged her out \& I got
barred from Delilah by her bouncer brother who had long Samson like hair.
I used know him from Palais in Schlossplatz a few years earlier 
\& he was quite obliging there but I suppose I got on his tits.
According to my father \& sister I act aggressively when high,
this is probably what barred me, I never
notice this myself even when I am back to normal after going high.
\paragraph
\noindent
I was starting to have either a religious experience or hallucinations,
In my first experience I put a letter into the door of another
catwoman in the local petshop who obviously loved cats in the window
there was these oriental cats who waved at you.
I put a note under the door that your oriental cats were saluting a white
Hitler ( me ) this letter I believe flew back into my pocket
but maybe I only thought I put down the correct note under the door 
( there always logical explanations for my visions ).
\paragraph
\noindent
I found another hangout for catwomen
in Hotel Archie which had a slight Bavarian Hitler
theme to it \& it had another of those oriental ceramic
cats like the one in the cat shop to salute this white Hitler, \&
I had a nice glass of wine there I was so impressed with the place
I hid a \euro50 tip under the tablecloth.
\paragraph
\noindent 
Later the same day I tried to buy a coffee for 50 Euros
\& was quite upset that the lady in the coffeeshop refused
to give me change, I went to a cash machine maybe I
was high \& confused but the ATM was acting completely
irrationally ( computer bug ? maybe ) even the keypad
looked illogical, I went back to the coffeeshop \& got
the coffee with the 50 Euro, later I tried to go
to Boeblingen \& was going to matchmake my ex maths teacher
Dave's daughter with Segher who worked in my
office before April, she oddly enough had been Boeblingen too in the past, 
Segher too was a mathematician \& won the
Netherlands maths Olympics when he was 17 the match I thought
was ideal. I started texting Carsten my friend about this suggestion
next thing the train stopped for 30 seconds \& a picture of Cornelia
appeared on the screen in a speech icon on my Nokia 3650 phone,
the phone was disagreeing with me \& wanted Cornelia for Segher,
the train then proceeded to pull into the same station that we just
left Schwabstrasse, amazing, was my phone having an argument with
me or was it a software bug which God inserted which was
supposed to occur at that precise time?, was the bug unique
to my phone \& God just created a few bit errors when
the ROM for my phone was made, was the trains endstop Schwabstrasse
\& was it pulling back on the other track into Schwabstrasse
I personally went for the miracle answer.
\paragraph
\noindent
I proceeded down to Boeblingen \& noticed I was controlling
the weather \& appearance of flowers by the size of my smile, I was high
as a kite next thing I went into IBM Klub \& gave Dimi the waiter my Greek
friend there a letter saying I was  dead \& had gone to Heaven 
\& took a Magnum ice cream from the fridge.
\paragraph
\noindent
At my craziest my worst texts I sent were to the Karate trainers
I was telling them I was shagging Princess the stripper outside
my door hoping to make Alex jealous, this was getting really out of hand.
I now believe at least some of my madness was caused out
of desperation within myself to settle down \& to do this
I was exploring boundaries of childishness I hadn't explored
as a child. 
\chapter{The Angels}
\paragraph
\noindent
A few days after my Padre Pio blasphemy, my hallucinations
really went into overdrive whole streets started showing
up from nowhere in Stuttgart city centre which I never
saw before \& everyone was behaving completely irrationally,
I was having an ``Alice in Wonderland'' pacmanland like experience,
Mark my friend a few months earlier was complaining about
the ladies in the canteen working at the tills wouldn't
change a \euro50 note for him, I was now seeing
women at the tills as a biblical reference.
I even met Charlie's Angels at the cinema 3 young ladies
were flirting with me at the cinema with ``Hauptfilm Lauft'' 
( Main film playing ) on all the information monitors,
next thing as I was walking away they went into the
Charlie's Angels Full Throttle poster pose.
I received a note from social workers that they were
in somewhat concerned about my behavior, I believed
I was dead \& that the Queen Margot bottle
of liqueur represented my sister Margo a basket represented
a basketcase ( me ) \& I was seeing other ``voodoo doll'' references
to souls I knew on my kitchen counter.
That night I went home \& my Nokia 3650 started answering
questions for me one beep for yes no beep for no.
I eventually went to sleep \& woke up with 2 policemen \& one policewoman
standing at the end of my bed ( Guards, My Guardian Angels).
One of them looked just like Mr. Ott a German champion boxer
from near home who recently died, it also could have been
``Miss Piggy's'' dead father she said she felt his presence
before looking after her, maybe he wanted revenge on me
for upsetting his daughter \& as a result drove me mad.
My angels however could have been psychics possibly from an alternate reality
or just ordinary people who God got to behave oddly.
God lets you see what you need to see it is unimportant how this happens.
They went through my wallet \& found my Irish Voluntary Health insurance
\& said this was invalid here, they found my Malteser card this
is a German charity which helps disaster victims,
I started recently sending \euro20 a month to this charity.
I got the idea that this was not going to be a normal night.
They asked me to dump my Converse ``All Star'' sneakers, I think this
is because I wouldn't catch Alex even though I was wearing
them, I thought this was an Omen \& they asked me to
dump my Eastman bag this Omen I think was because
I was to go west back to Ireland \& not to travel ``East Man''
to Germany.
They handcuffed me and led me downstairs \& asked me to talk to the policelady,
I was toungetied, how did they know I couldn't chat up women?
They proceeded to show me the kinds of sins I committed through
my life like judging people by how they looked, enforcing my opinions
on how people should live their life.
I wished I asked them some questions like why did
they handcuff me?, was I in purgatory?, were they
my gaurdian angels?
They carried me through some modest white gates which
I took to be the pearly gates of heaven, which they weren't
\& to see a doctor with one eye which looks one way
another eye which looks the other way a 'Popeye' as I called
them, anyway the message was not to judge people from the
way they looked. From there I went to the Burgerhospital the 
psychiatric hospital where people behaved equally oddly.
There was a girl there like my cousin Nancy \& I think the
message there was not to try to pressure her into getting
married she was perfectly happy the way she was. Another
time I looked over a doctors shoulder to see what he
was writing \& he pulled away the message there was
that I was nosy \& of course they made me give a urine
sample they were ``Taking the piss''. I found out
in St. Stephens that this was a normal practice when
patients go high.
\paragraph
\noindent
Anyway, I woke up the following morning in a psychiatric ward.
I believe my religious experience with the Angels taking
me to the psychiatric ward was Gods ``Tough Love'' way
to get me to give up the drink \& slow down.
Two weeks later I was left out, I got a ``jab in the ass'' of some
kind of anti psychotic which was supposed to last a month,
It didn't agree with me \& I was like a heroin junkie who
just came off drugs I was suicidal for 3 days until
I received another Drug from from a pharmacy to
counteract the side effects of the ``jab in the ass''.
My friend Ollie Cahill came over ( Thanks ) \& helped
me move back home for September the 19th.
I haven't ended up a nicer person after the experience,
inside I am still a child \& like pushing my boundaries,
to figure out what is acceptable behavior \& what
is not, maybe I never went mad maybe there is
no such thing maybe I never tested these boundaries
before \& people thought I was acting strangely
\& locked me up for that reason.
\paragraph
\noindent
Shortly after getting home I was high as a
kite again an insomniac sleeping about 3 hours a day.
I started dropping guitars down to the house
of friends who had moved away from home leaving the standard
``I am an Angel'' note with them, well if I am an Angel
I am a strange one, a queer hawk which doesn't take the chicken.
My sister Margo insisted that I go into my local GP,
I told him the brain is a map of the Universe
you travel to wherever you are in the head.
He said I had better go back to psychiatric
hospital I told him to ``Fuck Himself'' \& charged
out \& started walking home, I was picked up quarter
way up ``Nazareth Hill'' near home I took this as a sign
that I was a reincarnated Jesus \& had more trials to go. 
Before long the GP came to our house with Guards
\& some skididley Scottish square dance music
started up on his phone \& I told him ``You love
dancing don't you Tommy'' \& proceeded to do a 
square dance \& my sister looked on distressed.
To cut a long story short was escorted by the policemen
to St. Stephens Hospital Glanmire Co. Cork.
\paragraph
\noindent
After 6 weeks I got out \& was now
on a mood stabilizer called Zyprexa this
stuff costs the government about 340 Euro
a month, after about 6 months I gave it up
because it was making me drowsy, when having
lows on the medication.
\paragraph
\noindent
Around February I got a 6 week job in Skygaurd in England
who were developing a GPS/Mobile phone type device,
which acts as a Man Down Emergency Beacon when people get
into Trouble. The company was run out of a garden shed
there was really only one serious developer in the
whole company Richard he did all the hardware
development as well as most of the programming,
to be honest they needed at least 8 good hardware
developers as the cutting edge chips they were
making the hardware with were going obsolete
as quick as they were developing the software \& hardware.
There was an interesting girl there from Iraq,
she gave me the impression that she was happy
to be alive considering what was going on
in Iraq she had a very interesting perspective in life.
I was living there in a Bed \& Breakfast for 6 weeks
it was interesting how far my life had gone backwards
from the party lifestyle I had in Germany just from
a mental breakdown.
I had only one good weekend there when John Rudden
\& I went to Oxford, now that's a good party town.
\paragraph
\noindent
While there I met an interesting character
Ebrahim a modern day catholic apostle from Iran who changed his
religion from Muslim who was touched by God,
God gave him a Indian head massage one day at ,ass
while he was lying down which apparently was away
better than the leg massages I gave to my strippers.
Ebrahim was definitely the type of deliriously happy guy who
would be diagnosed as having hypomanic episodes \& locked
up by my psychiatrist if he could get his hands on him
because he thought with his heart rather than his head.
He had a successful business \& gave away all his money to follow
Jesus, Anton Wallace's timetravelling brother tried to do the
same thing \& was locked up for it.
The instant the thought that God wants me to join him
went through my head my Nokia 3650 Phone Beeped with a Calendar alarm
it was exactly 11pm \& I had an appointment possibly with God.
\paragraph
\noindent
About 2 months later I had an interview with Xen
in Cambridge \& got the impression I would
be out of my depth, I am a very good coder but I
would have needed to give up the drink to be able
for the job. I recommended that they should consider Samuel
Rydh the developer of Mac On Linux ( MOL ).
Soon after I got a job in Silicon \& Software Systems
in Cork, after about 7 weeks I was high
as a kite again just after I devised a stack castration algorithm
which I put it up on google groups for posterity. 
I spent 2 days trying to get a compile which should have taken 20 minutes,
the computer was giving me an abort retry dialog
box, I took this to be a message from God that
I should be doing something else, God wasn't going
to let me make any progress at work. 
The subjects of the spam in my bulk email folder appeared 
to have significance for me somewhat akin to a horoscope e.g. 
``You've won a million, God is watching you''.
I had a panic attack my team lead showed me
a headwreckingly long list of bugs she wanted me to fix.
My only answer to her was I was a roundy roundy
she was an uppey downey \& I am a cooperator \& I
can't fix uppey downeys bugs, I told her I was
driving a Mazda 323F Celebration ``a feeling'' \& ran out
out of work when my head went into spincycle.
This experience was slightly
different to my experience in Germany because this instead of
me running away with the faeries they were running away with me,
I didn't want this to happen to me, it just happened.
I left the usual ``I am an Angel''
note with the receptionist.
After about 2 days solid driving around the country,
this time the wiper on the back window of my 323F
was answering my questions one wipe for yes \& no wipe
for no, I checked my car \& the back wiper 
had no intermittent setting. 
The songs playing on my tape recorder were
completely indicative of my mood at that moment,
there were songs on the tape I never recorded.
\paragraph
\noindent
My first text which I wrote on the Killarney
road near Mallow was to Mick Julia's brother
with text like ``Grrr!!! Julia nearly castrated
Hitler, Now Eddie Van Halen is going to castrate Julia
with his razorblade''
\paragraph
\noindent
I was driving around the Kerry/Cork border
\& was listening to Van Halen \& was explaining
to my cousin Dave that I was a momo living from
moment to moment, above the law \& that no Policeman
could catch a momo because we are difficult to predict
because we have no plans. I suggested that Dave should
buy Singletons Tiny Cottage near our house at home \&
I was moving into the bungalow next door \& he could
defend me from the police with his pellet gun.
Keeping on the Van Halen theme I also asked Dave to ``Jump''
to Baljabunion with Aidan O'Halloran the singer out
of tears of joy. 
When Van Halen's song ``Panama'' came on the
tape recorder I thought Margo should as the lyrics
of the song go
``Reach down between her legs \& ease the seat back''
\& move into the our next door neighbours newly
refurbished house ``with Panama Jack'' her
boyfriend Ken. Basically our neighbour
is a ``Coochy coo'' type who makes my sisters
skin crawl \& she would really have to ease
the seat back to move in with him.
I got stopped by Gardai around
Castleisland \& I tried to drive off from them,
they took my details when I tried to escape,
thankfully I haven't received a ticket from them yet.
After this I thought it was a bad idea to go
any further back in Kerry \& thought I had
arranged to meet my cousin Dave at a bar called
``The Rock'' in Newmarket which I took to be
``The crossing'' for me to a better life.
Anyway I saw an advert for Middleton whiskey
on a framed mirror in the bar
\& guessed that Dave was in Middleton having
a whiskey where I met him before. Dave probably
never bothered reading a single text I sent him. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Being high I gave my Spanish guitar to Shays brother John 
leaving it outside his house with
a note that Shay had a job in Cork, the one I just
left working on PSOS when I was high \& I saw significance
in the fact the name of the set top box I was working
on was Humax which I took as an omen for Maximum Human.
The note I wrote to John would be pretty incomprehensible
to any sane person, it went something like
``John, Who are you, Scooby Doo or Ziggy Stardust,
I got a PSOS ``see MIPS run'' job for Shay in Cork,
Utter Madness!'' 
Shay's first job when he went to Silicon valley
was for ISI as a troubleshooter on an realtime operating system
called PSOS, mostly working on the 68000 \& MIPS processors.
Shay loved PSOS \& often was blowholing about how good it was,
it's memory footprint the fact that it was hard realtime etc..
When I learned it at S3 it was easy to see how it could
do meet all these requirements seeing as it had no memory
management, protection between processes or paging. 
John was selling his house \& I being high didn't want that,
I saw significance in the fact the realestate agents John
chose was www.myhome.ie, My Home, John's home \& as a result
left stuff like broken guitar pedals \& my brown wolly
coat under the wheel of his car at 3am in the night beeped
my horn at his house drove off \& came back a few times
\& left skidmarks on the gravel outside his house \&
I vandalized the for sale signs, I am quite embarrassed
about that.
\paragraph
\noindent
Eventually after the two days travelling I calmed
down \& went to ``The Local Bar'' \& was explaining
gibberish to Dee \& the barstaff that the time
on the clock in my car was a temperature gauge.
I went out to my car to start it to go to 
Newmarket to Top Car on Dee's suggestion that
he should trade in his Golf \& buy a Mazda 323F,
my brother anticipated I would drive off \& pulled
the cable off the battery to prevent it starting,
I complained to my cousin Tom that he headfucked
my car \& it wouldn't start.
I found another note in my car it was a ``security notice'
from S3 \& I interpreted this as a note of caution.
I was caught by the Guards again in ``The Local Bar''
near home \& escorted back to St. Stephens.
I went high a few times in St. Stephens on medication since but
have since stabilized after giving up drink which
was interfering with my Zyprexa by making me high
for several days after drinking.
The reason I go high is because Zyprexa \& alcohol
are both absorbed by the liver \& alcohol gets priority.
My cousin Tom Casey had a book The Art of War in his
toilet I assumed that the tyrant got me locked
up when I saw it initially in fact the book
is about ``art'', I made a mistake.
\paragraph
\noindent
While in St. Stephens the second time,
I met a guy called Denis
who teaches people like my illiterate father to read.
He can't live with himself because like Michael Jackson
he loves children the same way, he's a really nice pervert.
\chapter{Parlor Tricks \& Pranks}
\section{Steering the ladies from behind}
\paragraph
\noindent
Walking down the street with a group of girls, or
a girl boyfriend combo in front
of you it is possible to steer them from behind.
It works as follows, keep your hands down by your side,
but hold your hands as if you are riding a horse.
Wait for somebody coming in the opposite direction, at 
the opposite side to the way you want to steer the people
in front, as this person passes jerk your hands
suddenly as if you want to steer the girls like a horse.
The person coming opposite will look at your hands
\& the people you are trying to steer \& suddenly
stare at the people you are trying to steer \& look
at them as if to say ``You mean these ones'.
This will invade the personal space of the people
in front of you \& cause them to move away at
the person staring at them, It also has the
effect of making possessive boyfriends jealous
when the think some funny business is going on.
\section{Reading Minds}
\paragraph
\noindent
This is a trick I saw done in Stuttgart
at Cannister Wasen. A magicians helper goes around
\& asks members of the audience to think of a date of
their birthday \& tell
him/her. The helper then tells magician the date indirectly
by the way they phrase the question to the magician,
something like ``good lady give me the date please'' might be
split up as 20 for ``good lady', ``give me'' might 10,
'the date please'' might be 1968, creating a date 20/10/1968.
\section{Divining Property}
\paragraph
\noindent
This one I got from one of Feynman's books.
Ask a group of people to hide some property with you wish
to locate with your psychic divining abilities.
Get your divining rod \& ask the people who hid the
property to hold your arms while trying to divine the property.
Now every time you reach a junction when a decision needs
to be made about which way to go start jiggling the rod.
The most gullible person in the group who believes
in your divining abilities will lead you to the property
by pulling you.
\chapter{Counselling}
\paragraph
\noindent
The date is October 19 2005 I am currently in Unit 3,
St Stephens Hospital, Glanmire,Cork, Ireland.
A few weeks ago I was introduced to my counsellor Brendan O' Callaghan.
The reason I am telling nerds what I learned from counseling
is that I believe all nerds have similar life experiences
so going into detail in this section would be useful to them.
\paragraph
\noindent
\paragraph
\noindent
The counsellor \& I worked out that the crux of my
problem is that I never accept what happens to me \& move
on from it I always regret things that go wrong.
I also at the moment have a tendency to predict
bad fortune in the future even though it hasn't happened
yet. I am pessimistic about my future because I am worried
about how I can get a job abroad \& have to deal with
my prescriptions in Ireland, I don't want to
be shelling out around \euro400 per month for my drugs abroad
owing to not having health board coverage for most
of the expense like I have in Ireland.
The main problem I feel which drove me to a breakdown
is a lack of self discipline especially when
relating to drink \& strippers.
I also overspecialized in my work I should have
taken a more modest job near home which pays well 
\& started building a house around 1998, house prices
in Ireland have gone up around 300\% in the last
decade \& it is now almost impossible to get into
the property market, I made a lot of mistakes  \&
am now regretting them. 
Every experience we have in life has a function \&
as hard as my life has been in some ways I wouldn't
trade my life with anybody, I made my own decisions
\& am proud of what I have done with my life.
\paragraph
\noindent
My sister pointed out that everybody made mistakes \& have to live
with them, when I was 6 when I was obviously completely wrong 
about something I said to my sister that I never made mistakes,
nerds tend to believe the never make mistakes, they do.
\paragraph
\noindent
The most successful people in life are the people who can get on with life
without dwelling on mistakes, dwelling on mistakes is a complete waste of time
just try to learn from them quickly.
If you find your mind looping with regrets like ``I should have done 
such \& such',
change your thinking to ``I could have but chose not to at the time',
\& learn from your mistake stop dwelling on it.
Sometimes though if you have enough patience \& God may eventually give
you an answer to your problem when you relax \& stand back from it
if the problem demands you to move on taking by taking a far less 
attractive option stay away from the less attractive option \&
get on with the other parts of your life until it is absolutely
necessary to take the less attractive option.
\paragraph
\noindent
I have a cousin who used spend upto 19 hours a day working
for a manipulative headwrecker, she prided herself on making
beautiful meals for celebrities like Lenny Henry,
like the nerd she equated her sad idea of success with happiness.
She too ended up in a psychiatric hospital, It can happen to anyone.
\paragraph
\noindent
Life wouldn't be interesting for our psychiatrists, if they locked
up ``sane'' people.
Why did nobody lock up Hitler,
The answer given to me by my psychiatric doctor
was ``You don't have to be mad to be bad'. 
Unlike me Hitler had a lot of people protecting him,
I have since found out that he was diagnosed
by a military doctor as ``Dangerously Psychotic'.
In my opinion nobody is mad, ``madmen'' are just
asking God ``what the hell is wrong with me',
it just takes a little time before he answers
that question, it's a growing experience for people.
My friend Klaus knew a chauffeur for Hitler
\& he told Klaus that he was a nice quite amiable guy.
I believe Hitler had one problem he could never quite
forgive the Jewboy for kicking him in the nuts \& he
went around looping the same words ``I hate Jews',
Hitlers monster henchmen just took him a bit too
literally \& gave Hitler his revenge, Jews kill
any of your children who kick other boys in the
nuts for a name calling it saves a lot of lives
in the long run.
\paragraph
\noindent
I have figured out myself that I keep giving away to people
things that they don't ask for, 
I just assume they want them \& they usually don't.
I was doing this especially when I was high.
With books it's usually that it the book is beyond me
\& I don't have the time to get to grips with the subject
\& know that the other person would be more suited to reading
the book \& giving me grinds, the remainder of the books I give away
when I have read them to people whom I think may be interested
in the subject but they usually aren't.
When high I give away guitars when I am trying to mend bridges
usually ones I have nuked, I should stop giving people things
unless I am sure they want them \& they ask for them especially advise.
\paragraph
\noindent
The long term goals I wish to achieve from my current
starting point in the psychiatric ward on drugs which
I don't like are the following.\\\\
My own house near home.\\\\
A wife or girlfriend who could help me running my
business \& potentially help me expand it.\\\\
A business with a future which is enjoyable.\\\\
\paragraph
\noindent
My Emotional Assets to help me achieve my
goals are... I can be quite Emphatic when I have
some time to think what cause people to react in a 
particular way \& I have definite realistic goals.
\paragraph
\noindent
I have identified quite a few barriers which
I need to recognize \& deal with which if I neglect may prevent
me reaching the goals I set out for myself.
Barriers are often functional \& keep us safe
\& help define how we act in certain situations.
It is worth ones while to decide which barriers
should be got rid of.
I think these barriers I have may be common to most nerds.
\paragraph
\noindent
My stubbornness \& unwillingness to challenge my own values
with respect to what it means for me to be a success.\\\\
I am not spontaneous \& too slow to move when an opportunity
arises e.g. chatting up an available good looking woman,
the early bird catches the worm.\\\\
I am a nerd \& as such poor at dealing with people,
I need to become better at dealing with social situations.\\\\
Rather than respecting myself I am a self destructive
attention seeker.
I am hoping to get the attention of a potential partner
who will take up the job of fixing me. As a result
of having a partner I hope to gain high self worth
\& finish with my self destructive habits \&
turn myself into an alpha Male.\\\\
I hate failure \& am unwilling to take risks.\\\\
I try to give people orders, especially when high
rather than cooperate with people in order to achieve goals.
\paragraph
\noindent
The other things that came out in counselling was that I am
very unidirectional  \& obsessive compulsive in my search to
fulfill my wants \& needs, mainly women. 
I have a real fear of failure I am doing the search ``my way'' \&
for me I believed there was no alternative, of course there is, I needed to
reevaluate my options \& values. 
I have been running around disco's since
I was 17 going as often as possible to meet women \& used
freak out when going to a disco impossible even for one night.
What was interesting about this is the only disco I ever
actually enjoyed even if I didn't meet a woman was
Perkins Park in Stuttgart. I made friends with nearly
all the people working there.
\paragraph
\noindent
This search naturally progressed to stripclubs once
that option became open to me in my life. This search
for me was a like a ``headless chicken'' search for lost
keys, there are always other options if you relax.\\\\
Not bothering looking \& just waiting till you run
into the keys, this is a far easier way to meet women
if you can be spontaneous chatting them up.
However, I always get toungetied when it come's
to chatting up women.\\\\ 
The other option is to sit
down \& retrace the steps in your head where you
might have left them. This is equivalent to
thinking about what options as potential girlfriends
you might have \& asking them out for a date.
If you keep running around chasing things
you won't notice what you need which may be sitting right
before your eyes.
\paragraph
\noindent
My counsellor also thought there was a lot of
pathos or black humour in my book which he quite enjoyed.
He found it interesting that I managed to form
good relationships with what he considered
'shady'' characters like strippers \& I could see the
humanity within them, I personally find them
as complete as any normal person just occasionally
complete headwrecks which I enjoy in a sado masochistic way,
I learn a lot about myself from them,
the experience has been worthwhile.
\paragraph
\noindent
I have also noticed in myself when I get fed up
with people I have a tendency of nuking bridges
rather than just burning them, I get a buzz
out of nuking bridges with people who really
deserve it, this is self destructive, in the long
run I have regretted nuking these bridges but I
suspect I would have regretted leaving them 
standing too, I could have struck a better balance.
It is a lot politically wiser to just back
off from these people when you need to,
if you are dealing with fair weathered friends
become a friendliest fair weathered friend 
on the planet like Don King for them
too. You may never know when you may need them
\& get a chance to use them back.
\chapter{I'm a nerd what is wrong with me}
\paragraph
\noindent
Nerds have a lot wrong with them,
extreme nerds sometimes prefer interacting other nerds over
the internet than talking to the people sitting next
to them.
As Denis Noonan said to me nerds should never marry nerds
they sometimes produce autistic children,
this is not a joke, its a fact.
\paragraph
\noindent
My sister did a bit of research on this topic
\& what she found fit me even if my psychiatric
doctors disagreed with the diagnosis.
If the symptoms below sound like something you may
have go to a psychiatric doctor who may be able
to diagnose the problem correctly.
\paragraph
\noindent
There are two common mild forms of autism
which are so similar that you would need to
split hairs on your diagnosis to actually
decide whether a person has one or the other,
like most psychiatric illnesses they are only
labels used to distinguish an illness from
a spectrum of symptoms. The two mild
forms of autism are called Kanners early
infantile autism \& Asperger Syndrome the
one we will concentrate on as it appears
to be most applicable to Nerds \& is
most prevalent in boys which most nerds are.
\paragraph
\noindent
The symptoms of Asperger's syndrome are:\\\\
Bad coordination especially in childhood,
learning to talk before you can walk.\\\\
Inability to read non verbal social cues,
unusual eye contact in social interactions,
these problems can be minimized by being
'thought'' correct way to respond to
social cues while young.\\\\
Shyness, usually making unpleasant interactions
with other people \& chance of failure of 
these interactions may cause asperger sufferer
not to bother.\\\\
Good points: They are saints, as with all autistics,
honesty, faithfulness, lack of hidden agendas,
one measure of lack of autism a measure of how compulsive \&
imaginative a liar you are, not necessarily qualities I want.\\\\
Bad points: selfishness \& lack of empathy\\\\
Some asperger sufferers never have dated anyone
\& inept at forming relationships with the opposite sex.\\\\
Adults are prone to getting bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.\\\\
Tendency to have chosen topics of conversation \& keep rambling
on about them even to uninterested partys.\\\\
An interesting insight I got into autism is Mike
a neighbour \& friend blow in from Mohoreen
has a son who is autistic, he has a photographic
memory \& can learn off a phonebook, his
brain processes so much information that
it takes him 3 years to come up with an
answer to any question. It isn't that he
is stupid it's because he is really thoughtful,
\& has a photographic memory \& as a result
is simply processing too much information,
it takes him ages reading a phone book
to realize the information he is processing
isn't of much use.
He wastes a lot of time trying to figure
out what people are thinking this normally
takes me 6 months I am a bit autistic too.
it'll take him till he is 60 to reach
his potential. Paulii the physicist
who discovered the Paulii exclusion principle
I suspect he was autistic too like my other
autistic friend Aaron he used breaks all
around him he was so clumsy no experimenter
wanted to be in a room with him.
\chapter{Evaluation of my experience with my Angels \& Demons}
\paragraph
\noindent
I wonder how different the mathematician John Nash,
A beautiful mind's experience was from my own.
The immortal faeries he saw could have been
his guardian angels.
Almost definitely the demons or whatever it was 
which possessed my mobile phone \& car were not
answering questions too intelligently they appear
to me to have no purpose other than to indicate
to me that I was going mad \& torment me somewhat.
I would suspect that John Nash's faeries behaved similarly.
The only experience I had which was unambiguous
was the meeting I had with my gaurdian angels
\& being honest they were a fire \& brimstone lot.
\section{Demons possessing inanimate objects}
\paragraph
\noindent
Earlier in the book I described how I had an argument
with my mobile phone \& it won.
There are at least three possibilities of what happened in the
reality I was witnessing:\\
1) The phone was temporarily possessed by a demon or angel.\\
2) God intervenes directly.\\
3) Machines themselves have feelings.\\
\paragraph
\noindent
Nothing physical exists in our brains to indicate that
it holds the seat of consciousness, maybe free consciousnesses
can float around and inhabit anything they like or
consciousness permeates everything in the Universe.
Machines are in our reality just rule following idiots
this is why we think they don't have feelings.
They may be conscious in an ``Alice in Wonderland'' reality.
Maybe the reason the pioneer spacecraft is
40,000 KM off course is not because of a new law of
physics but because it is bored \& lonely,
the notion that machines have no
feelings is beaten out of children as they get older. 
My Nokia 3250 had a picture of Richard Feynman on
the front of it could it have been possessed by him?
\chapter{Conclusion of Biography}
\paragraph
\noindent
On November 20th 2005 I was supposed to visit Fr. Bill
the Indian priest faith healer on a 6 day retreat 
in Newry Co. Down with Mary.
Mary was 3 times suicidal whom Fr. Bill
cured from depression. I am finishing the
book now because my religious experience
has gone full circle since going mad \& meeting
my guardian angels, my experience started with
a religious experience it may as well finish with one.
I changed my mind about going I already met my
angels \& had my miracle science the drugs I am on
are hopefully curing me \& didn't need 6 days
praying to behave like a holy Joe, the prayer
Mary thought me was short \& sweet
Praise you Jesus, Thank you Jesus,
the Rosary is a bit repetitive for me
everyone to their own.
I will instead meet Fr. Bill for one day
in Knock Ireland in March.

\chapter{Theories of consciousness, madness \& other things}
\section{Theory of consciousness determining reality}
\paragraph
\noindent
I am quite confident that the Theory of
consciousness determining reality holds water.
Nobody yet has managed to punch a hole in it
\& I have passed it onto a few devils advocates who
are quite competent at quantum physics.
The latest version of this theory can be downloaded from
\url{http://www.ariasoft.ie/ebooks/theoryofcdr.pdf}
\paragraph
\noindent
In the following few paragraphs using known \& generally
accepted principles \& theories of quantum mechanics \&
one small addition of my own
I provide what I feel is strong evidence that there is a Heaven
\& that timetravel is a rare but normal occurrence.
If you cannot understand the arguments I present below
I suggest researching further on
\url{http://www.google.com} or alternatively buying\\
Introducing quantum Theory by J.P Mc Evoy \& Oscar Zarate \&\\
Q is for quantum by John Gribbin from\\
\url{http://www.amazon.com} or similar.
\paragraph
\noindent
Just because drugs can induce hallucinations \&
there is an area of the mind devoted to fantasy
doesn't mean to me that hallucinations are ``in the mind'.
If you are sure hallucinations are just ``in the mind'
you need to learn quantum physics.
I am about to show that everybody in the world may have equal
right to believe their own perspective of reality even the madman.
The madman may just be viewing a different equally physical Universe to
that perceived by sane people.
\paragraph
\noindent
The role of a conscious observer is of very real importance 
to what we know as reality.
As far as quantum physics is concerned \& to understand it
you need to unlearn all the Newtonian physics you have learned
since you were 3 years old \& re philosophize.
\paragraph
\noindent
The Schroedinger Cat thought experiment was originally thought up
by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger in 1926 to 
highlight the ridiculousness of quantum physics
it now is being used as an example to describe how
quantum physics really is.
In the thought experiment a cat is locked into a closed box with a radioactive
substance which ejects a radioactive particle at
random intervals, there is also a radiation detector in the box 
which will detect this radioactive particle if it is ejected,
if a radioactive particle is detected a gun goes
off which kills the cat. The box is soundproof \& all
the walls are opaque so the only way of telling
if the cat is dead is by opening the box.
The rules of quantum physics dictate that the cat is in a
superposition of states, both alive \& dead
until the box is opened \& observed by a conscious
observer, this conscious observer by observing causes
a ``crystallizing of reality'' which
in quantum physics is called the ``collapse of the wave function'.
This superposition of states is the cornerstone to the
``many worlds'' theory.
\paragraph
\noindent
The strong anthropic principle states that 
the Universe must have those properties which allow life to 
develop within it at some stage in its history.
In other words the a Universe cannot form unless
there are conscious observers to watch it at some
stage in its history.
\paragraph
\noindent
Whenever a sub atomic event with multiple possible outcomes
occurs all of these outcomes become real and form
a series of parallel Universes that have a separate
existence \& development. Our consciousness
inhabits just one of them, the reality we experience. 
This is the ``many worlds'' theory as initially proposed
by American Physicist Hugh Everett, these many worlds
coexisting is another building block in my argument.
\paragraph
\noindent
I am now about to give you the most important idea in this argument.
Because the conscious mind is of central importance to what
one perceives as reality, I believe that altering the brain's state 
e.g. by giving the victim drugs, alters the 
reality the victim experiences to one of the other ``many worlds''
different to the one 
experienced by the rest of us who don't 
have our brain state altered, this is somewhat akin
to the victim tuning into a different television channel than
the one that sane people watch.
There are other ways of altering our brain state
besides Drugs e.g. a strong electromagnetic
field may alter the way synapses in the brain fire, a victim
having a brain hormone imbalance \& going mad will cause
the victim to experience an alternate reality.
\paragraph
\noindent
Altering the brain's state while the victim is alive 
is equivalent to altering the victims conscious state.
We are spiritual beings, God made us flawed ``machines'
completely understandable to ourselves from a science
perspective so we would be able to learn to repair ourselves
except for our consciousness, this is our soul.
Daniel C. Dennett of ``Consciousness Expained'' fame
interesting arguments trying to explain away
consciousness by saying it doesn't exist, but wrong.
The brain is only a physical manifestation where
consciousness takes place while the victim is alive.
Doctors may talk about scientific things like brain
hormones \& can find out when we are dreaming by 
measuring brainwaves \& have a basic map of
what part of the brain does what from
measuring brain activity \& studying braindamaged
victims, but to be honest they don't have a clue how
brains work, this alteration of brain state has to be
accepted as being spiritual. Science might one day
be able to explain the brain as a consciousless
zombie computer which has neural net algorithms
deciding what to do next, but I wouldn't expect
it anytime soon.
\paragraph
\noindent
I myself personally believe that God normally only 
crystallizes the reality of one Universe for normal people 
\& then creates others temporarily when observers need 
to witness an alternate Universe, this alternate
Universe may be created by some variant of the
anthropic principle.
\paragraph
\noindent
People witnessing the virgin Mary in Lourdes or similar 
are multiple people seeing the same hallucination,
this is how Mary does her work, like most women
she is chatty \& likes talking to people, nice woman.
Surely it is much easier for God to create one
alternate reality for these people to tune into
than give them all ``in the head'' experiences. 
The only difference between these visions \& the hallucination
of a madman's that nobody else witnesses the madman's hallucination
so he has nobody to back him up.
\paragraph
\noindent
Rarely after a lot of drink people believe they
are being chased by Rats \& attempt to climb walls etc.
to avoid them. This commonly happens to people suffering
from Delirium Tremors DT's. This I think is not
a figment of peoples imagination but a very real experience
in an alternate reality, I believe this is God's way to 
scare the crap out of self destructive drunks to get them
give up drink.
\paragraph
\noindent
For conscious entities time is just a measure of rhythmic
machine ``ticks', sometimes it moves fast, sometimes it moves
slow, ``A watched kettle never boils.', in life \& death
situations time moves very slowly for conscious beings so
they get time to react, for some people their entire
life flashes before them in a moment. I strongly suspect
very large doses of adrenalin slows down time for the victim.
If slowing down time for conscious beings is possible why not timetravel?,
Some people in who get put into psychiatric hospitals
experience timetravel these grandiose thoughts can be caused
by a lot of psychotic disorders but are generally caused
by a serotonine \& dopamine hormone imbalance.
In the book ``Breaking the time barrier'' by Jenny Randles,
several people have claimed to timetravel including
the inventor of AC electricity Nikola Tesla.
The ``time machines'' these people use typically
generate an electromagnetic field around the brain
which the inventors claim generates an
``alternate state of consciousness'' whether
these inventions work is questionable but their
operation is consistent with my theory.
\paragraph
\noindent
God has been providing people with glimpses \& hints
of Heaven at least since man first walked the earth.
Outer body experiences or OBE's 
are usually near death experiences when the 
soul or consciousness temporarily leaves the body
\& floats above it, from this perspective the person
having the OBE can see things which would be impossible
to see if the consciousness remained in the body.
It is caused I believe by a lack of oxygen to the brain.
When the person is brain dead I believe the consciousness 
is fully released from the body \&
allowed to rejoin the cosmic consciousness or
even go to what I believe is Heaven that 
``bright light, happy place'' that some good OBE victims experience.
I'd suspect Heaven is where all the good souls become one \& hell
is where all the bad people get locked up in a rubber room isolated
from everybody else.
\paragraph
\noindent
LSD \& Magic Mushrooms I believe can take drug abusers to ``Alice in Wonderland'
alternate realities, these realities can be places where the World
is flat \& the planets are carried around by angels, Galileo I suspect was
only correct about our reality. Terence a friend said he once after
taking LSD saw policemen as pigs on wheels.
\section{What is the Universe theory}
\paragraph
\noindent
This theory may not be completely original as I heard of
the Universe being described as a process before by quantum physicists.
%What we traditionally think of as particles in the Newtonian sense
%Electrons, Protons, Neutrons, Photons, Billiard Balls exist as waves
%which interfere with themselves when we are not looking,
%they only turn into particles by the act of observing them,
%this property of ``Particles'' is called ``Wave Particle Duality'.
\paragraph
\noindent
There is a concept in quantum mechanics which Einstein
referred to as ``Spooky action at a distance'' or the EPR paradox.
This happens when a pair of particles e.g. electrons 
interact with each other \& are set up to have a quantum
property e.g. total spin to be 0.
The electrons then fly apart not interacting with anything else
till the experimenter decides to look at them while the
particles are travelling apart across the Universe,
they are both in a superposition of spin states, both up \& down.
When the experimenter decides to measure the spin property
of one electron owing to the ``collapse of the wavefunction'
described in the previous section.
the spin property of the other electron
is instantaneously equal but opposite, i.e one
electron spin up the other has spin down, this
shows that non-locality is indeed a property of
the quantum world. 
How can the Universe be considered 3 dimensional
in the Newtonian sense if interactions can
happen across its entire width instantaneously.
The Universe is not really a ``thing'
as you would expect in Newtonian physics,
it is a process in Gods mind which is brought
into reality by conscious observers like ourselves observing it.
Newtonian physics allowed instantaneous action at a distance
too, with gravity, but made no attempt to explain it.
\paragraph
\noindent
God could make everything in this Universal process happen instantaneously
but doesn't, he makes most things travel below the speed of light,
the reason for this is that if he made everything happen
instantaneously the Universe would be over in an instant
rather than have a big bang the Universe would be more
like a big instantaneous impulse.
\paragraph
\noindent
Most people think that Einsteins theory of relativity
states that nothing can travel faster than light,
this is probably not the case, there are theoretical particles
called tachyons which travel at slowest a tiny bit faster
than light upto infinite speed.
The fact a tachyon if it exists is able to go at infinite speed 
is more evidence that the Universe is a process in Gods mind.
\paragraph
\noindent
Einstein once said ``are we thereby to suppose that
the Moon ceases to exist if we stop watching it?', 
I personally believe this is the case even if it 
is unimportant to my argument, why would God
expend energy in creating a Universe that nobody is looking at,
this would be akin to writing an inefficient computer algorithm,
anybody who has ever written a raytracer knows the importance
of optimization.
I believe God only creates as much of the Universe as
conscious observers need to see observing it from moment to moment.
As such there is no end to the Universe, God will just
keep creating vacuum as conscious entities are travelling
through it. Beyond the furthermost planets from the
centre of the Big Bang the Universe is very boring.
\section{Science unites with Religion}
\paragraph
\noindent
Science will allow us eventually to live till our
Universe collapses to the big antibang or our Universe
dies of ``Heat Death'.
God gave us a fear of death to sort out the good ones
from the bad greedy ones, nobody can survive the end
of the universe, science won't let it. Be a nice guy
die a peaceful death \& go to Heaven, it's easier.
\section{Theories of Madness}
\paragraph
\noindent
People who hear voices or have split personalities
I believe are genuinely possessed, they appear to be inhabited 
by 2 consciousnesses,
drugs only cure the symptoms not the problem. 
I personally think they need to see a priest
to exorcise their demons permanently.
I have met tramps who live on the streets say
things to me they should have no knowledge of,
I believe they are possessed.
\paragraph
\noindent
In Burgerhospital I believe I was in a room with somebody
who was so out of their mind they were in mine,
he knew what I was thinking \& verbalizing it with his groans.
I admit this however may have just be a feeling like deja vu,
when I was high driving my Mazda 323F around while high I
felt that the songs on the tape recorder 
\& radio were exactly indicative of
my mood, maybe my mood while high just followed 
the songs on the tape recorder \& radio.
\paragraph
\noindent
Anorexia is almost definitely form of madness, skinny people who think they are
fat, the only reason they aren't locked up is they are not
offending anybody else like I was when high, doctors do you care enough
to give them drugs to bring them back to reality.
maybe likewise for dyslexics but unlikely,
letters may be floating off the page because you are hallucinating,
egomaniacs who can be fooled into thinking they come up with
brilliant ideas are also a bit mad.
\paragraph
\noindent
I think People with Alzheimer's are living in an alternate reality \&
from their reality ``sane'' people act like they have Alzheimer's.
\paragraph
\noindent
Mental breakdowns are caused by being headwrecked to submission by life \&
being unable to see a way out, people suffering breakdowns should
seek counselling to get the look in the mirror.
Below is an example of a cruel experiment to give a dog 
a mental breakdown, it is described in Asimov's guide to Science
When you shine an ellipse on the floor give the dog a reward,
When you shine a circle on the floor give the dog an electric shock.
Now make the ellipse more \& more like a circle.
When the dog can no longer tell the difference the dog
will have a mental breakdown.
\paragraph
\noindent
People in cults who worship aliens are probably as mad
as hatters but are probably meeting aliens in their own
reality \& cloning humans too.
\section{The Cosmic Consciousness} 
\paragraph
\noindent
The Cosmic Consciousness is the sum total of all the individual
consciousnesses in the Universe
\& as such is a small part of the
mind of God, we are all part of it \& are
masters of our own destiny.
The cosmic consciousness may only have a set number
of Memes \& these may all have been exhausted
billions of years ago by more advanced civilizations than us in
the Universe.
\paragraph
\noindent.
Every conscious individual is an ABBA ( A to B, B to A ) echo of everyone else
in the cosmic consciousness. When U2 play live in concert
the band are an ABBA echo of the 60,000 people in the stadium,
a concert is a mass orgy,
they feed off the energy \& lifeforce of the crowd 
\& I suspect U2 could never achieve this kind of energy in Band Practice.
When Julia kicked me in the family jewels I started the fight
by calling him his nickname I started the ABBA interaction.
When ABBA echoes cooperate things get easier for us.
Like the song Universes rhythm is a dancer.
\paragraph
\noindent
Dreams \& hallucinations might be alternate realities where the laws of physics
\& logic are different, Alice in Wonderland, Dr. Who,
X-Men, Spidermen ( thanks Marvel for the great Pulp Fiction ),
Superman, Back to the future, 
Terminator 3 ( you've been warned ) \& 2001 Space Odyssey
are all visions in the single cosmic consciousness \&
therefore might exist in alternate realities.
I'd suspect every thought anyone has ever had has occurs
in the present moment in some reality.
\paragraph
\indent
Ideas may fly in \& out of conscious beings from one person
to another like Pigeons flying in \& out of Pigeonholes.
The best Eureka ideas often fly so fast between people
they almost hit them at the same time.
The best ideas are often quickly forgotten
so it is best to write them down instantly when they occur.
For instance a friend of mine in Germany developed
software for watching a millionaire friends castle
in Tenerife \& he was able to open \& close doors
in the Castle using SMS messages \& his mobile phone.
I thought this idea would be ideal if a web browser or similar 
could be run on a mobile phone so that farmers would
be able to watch cows calving while away from the farm
\& only need to go home when the cow is ready to calve.
My cousin Dermot found a picture of
the same idea was implemented \& 
exhibited at the Irish Plowing Championships that year. 
\paragraph
\noindent
I could be completely wrong about this so a good argument
with a cognitive scientist or child psychologist might help.
Our level of consciousness maybe a measure of the ideas,
concepts \& amount of life experience we have in our heads.
When we humans are born we are pretty much a blank slate,
all we know how to do at this stage is 
breathe, gurgle, laugh, smile, cry, move randomly,
demonstrate reflexes, breastfeed, recognize familiar objects,
excrete, urinate, we have a lot to learn.
People love their children not for who they are at this
stage but for their near infinite potential.
I am very much anti abortion except for possibly
the morning after pill I suspect no brain has
formed at this early stage but would argue that babies
themselves are barely conscious.
I am pro stem cell research.
If God was against stem cell research he
would let us know somehow.
I don't care how stem cells are harvested,
every time a teenager masturbates he flushes
millions of potential lives down the toilet,
a few cells in a test tube is not sacred.
Surely stem cell research is less taboo than Frankenstein like
operations like organ donations where organs
are usually taken from people on life
support machines \& these people are then
left to die.
\paragraph
\noindent
Conscious beings are vessels for carrying memes in the cosmic
consciousness spread all your good ones without inhibition before you die
to keep the cosmic consciousness vibrant,
it may be the memes \& values that want to survive not
us conscious beings, humans,
surviving is hard work \& quite stressful
especially if you haven't much to live for like children.
\section{Timetravel}
\paragraph
\noindent
Harry Potter is to me very boring, 
if you are open minded enough fact is often far more
interesting than fantasy.
I think people who think they have talents in psychiatric wards
are X-Men living in an alternate reality
keeping that reality in check.
My sister's kids think they are Power Rangers
\& Spider Men, they are inspired by them.
Pat O'Sullivan a musician friend who was in the
hospital with me thought he was The Incredible Hulk when he was a 
kid \& hammered himself off walls, he recently jumped though
a Window in a door 4 foot from the ground on the first night he was locked up;
he only came out with a small cut in his for head, in my
opinion he is more like Wolverine, an indestructible lunatic
who hates will castrating over protective psychiatric
doctors messing with him. As often as not it
is the narrowminded control freaks who get you 
committed who should be locked up. Pat should be starring in Jackass.
\paragraph
\noindent
Timetravelers may fix things when we destroy ourselves in an alternate reality,
e.g. the Kennedy brothers,
did an escalation of the 1962 missile crisis happen in an alternate reality?,
nuclear war?, forensics has proven that
Lee Harvey Oswald couldn't have taken the shot,
I suspect he was a scapegoat, okay there also is
another theory it's a known fact that the Kennedys were
really pissing the Mafia \& Fidel Castro off maybe they did the hit job,
maybe a jealous lover, Marylin Monroe?, everybody knows
John F. needed a conveyor belt drawing ladies to him,
he made a lot of enemies.
\paragraph
\noindent
A friend of mine's ``timetravelling brother'' found a cure
for Aids in an ``Alice in Wonderland'' Universe.
Timetravelers in psychiatric wards
may hold the key to timetravel in our or another reality,
\& probably travelling faster than light.
Doctors have a look around the psychiatric hospitals to
find the timetravelers believe they are correcting 
things happening in this reality,
they may be useful people to know \&
I personally would like to hear their theories about 
how they are doing it \& their chemical imbalances in the
brain which may be causing it.
\paragraph
\noindent
Some Physicists believe positrons ( antimatter electrons )
are electrons travelling backward in time \& likewise
for other antimatter particles.

.
\paragraph
\noindent
Maybe loving something brings it to life literally e.g.
Babies, Performers like Michael Jackson \& in an alternate
reality inanimate \& abstract objects
Machines, Mathematics, Physics, Music, Art
\& unfortunately more negative things like the Occult.
In Breunninger at Christmas they are Santa
Klaus Jazz Musicians who can bring Jingle Bells
to life for me, I can't play it but I can
do an average Yngwie Malmsteen when I get going
on Guitar.
\paragraph
\noindent
My 97 Mazda 323F can be considered a voodoo doll of me,
it had a dent in it's
left rear bumper when I bought it representing the
varicoseal on my left testicle. I might get my
left testicle panel beaten by a surgeon sometime.
\paragraph
\noindent
The notepad I am writing down notes for my book
in is another voodoo doll of my thought process.
\section{Psychics}
\paragraph
\noindent
A psychic predicted to my mother that my grandmother
would die within a year, I sincerely hope this
wasn't a self fulfilling prophesy \& my mother
didn't tell my grandmother to scare her into
having reduced resistance to cancer.
\paragraph
\noindent
God I suspect doesn't let psychics perform under the
pressure of scientific skeptics he wants
people to have faith, God only gives psychic
talents to modest people who don't blowhole about
it \& not to publicity seeking Edjits.
Yuri Geller bends soft spoons
with his fingers ( it's miraculous sure Yuri ),
he starts watches for a few percent of people 
who phone up whatever
T.V. Talkshow he is on by peoples hands heating up old dried up oil
in the watches clockwork mechanism this makes the oil less viscous 
\& the watches start going again temporarily.
Yuri is popular because he is a handsome likable guy \& a celebrity
that annoys everybody because he is a complete fake \& bullshit artist,
he plays on the fact he makes Talkshows interesting.
\paragraph
\noindent
One time when testing my own
psychic ability I correctly guessed Pat \& John
Shinnicks birthdays, I had approximately a 1 in 365x365
chance of doing this, however it
is possible that Pat was bullshitting me that I
got his \& Johns birthday correct, Pat may
possibly have told me his birthday previously \& my
subconscious recalled it but I think this is unlikely.

\section{Random anecdotes that cannot easily be categorized}
\paragraph
\noindent
People are reincarnated by sharing Memes ( Ideas ) e.g.
I have been influenced by
Richard Feynman(A Jew), Richard Stallman(Another Jew),
Esther( A crazy gymnastic stripper Jew),
Adolf Hitler(Somebody who didn't like Jews much)
Eddie Van Halen, Phil Lynott, Michael Flatley
of RiverDance Fame, Bin Laden, Jesus Christ,
gold medal Olympic gymnasts, Breakdancers,
\& Saddam Hussein because of his survival skills.
These peoples Memes have infected me \& inspired me therefore
as a person I am a reincarnated dolly mixture of all the above.
\paragraph
\noindent
Statistics might have nothing to do with luck when God is
involved. My father won a lot of money in a local lotto
for my sister who needed the money.
Having more money doesn't make you any happier in
the long run the elation period after winning
money is approximately 2 years.
\paragraph
\noindent
My father is 73 \& I believe is old beyond his years,
he was hunting horses at 69 but has difficulty walking
uphill now, he has aged 20 years in the last 5. 
He has had several near death experiences, I believe
he died several times in alternate realities.
My mother died of breast cancer at 45 my sister thinks
people who die of cancer don't care enough for themselves
\& care too much for other people, I tend to agree with her,
My mother like me was a stressbucket, I suspect God lets us
live as long as we can fight for life \& my mother let go, gave up
on it \& had a fairly quick trip to Heaven.
My mother dying of cancer was Gods way to let my father
\& my mother to part ways. My father could not
have met Chrissie his current girlfriend
if my mother or Chrissie's dead husband was on the scene.
\paragraph
\noindent
My father \& a friend named Mike had an argument
that my father didn't carry his Uncle
home from the Pub one night about 5 years ago.
My father is insistent that he did,
Mike is insistent that he didn't.
Alcohol is believed to affect memory,
so do knocks in the head,
what if knocks \& alcohol did something different,
could it be that My father, Mike, \& his Uncle temporarily traveled
in different realities owing to being drunk.
What probably happened in our reality was either;
my father dropped him off a place which he thought
was Mikes Uncles home, or Mikes Uncle was so
pissed he got lost at his own doorstep \& made
a 5 mile walk home out of what should have been
20 meters.
\paragraph
\noindent
Owing to having a more hard wired brain Animals have 
a severe head start on us at a conscious
level when they are born, it is called instinct,
humans catch up when they reach about two years old.
\paragraph
\noindent
Being high low \& out of your mind as well as being
an intuitive description of the state of mind of a person is in
I could be taken more literally as a description
of the alignment of the emotional conscious mind with the body.
Anti psychotics/mood stabilizers such as Zyprexa which I
am on improve this alignment. Drugs which deal
with split personalities exorcise any Demons
( extra consciousnesses ) which may be in the mind temporarily,
Psychotic drugs like Cocaine make you high \& 
misalign the emotional consciousness of the person taking them
\& make the emotional consciousness high i.e.above the head of 
the person who is high.
\paragraph
\noindent
If I died every night \& a new clone got all my
ideas \& life experiences transferred to the
clone would it matter, I suspect not much.
\paragraph
\noindent
Did you ever fly around the room in a bed when drunk?,
it's an alternate rollercoaster wibbly wobbly reality.
\paragraph
\noindent
Aliens may be are visiting us, but mostly
in alternate realities, most of them are simply
too far away, millions if not billions of lightyears 
to be visiting us in this reality.
\paragraph
\noindent
People may be Aliens in alternate realities.
\paragraph
\noindent
Whether the World rotates every 24 hours on its axis
or whether the entire Universe rotates around the Earth
every 24 hours is a matter of perspective, its
all relative, the Earth can be considered as the
centre of the Universe any celestial object can,
the only thing stopping this perspective is
that some of the planets far away from the earth
would have to travel faster than light.
The Pope who persecuted Galileo for his
blasphemy about the Earth being centre of
the Universe was correct as well, the only
way that it isn't the centre of the Universe
is that it most likely is not its centre of mass.
\paragraph
\noindent
Ciaran a guy I met in St. Stephens Hospital
had an ex girlfriend who claimed
to have given birth to a 7 year old Angel.
\paragraph
\noindent
Mathematicians could 1+1=3 in an alternate ``Alice in Wonderland'' reality.
\paragraph
\noindent
Being gay is an aggression tactic
to keep the narrowminded out of family trees.
People may become gay if they get bored or fed up
with the opposite sex, ask George Michael the singer if you 
don't believe me.
\paragraph
\noindent
Self destructive behavior such as consuming large
amounts of drink \& drugs are only symptoms of
deeper problems. Going to AA is only curing
the symptom not the problem. There are plenty people 
who have mental breakdowns \& never consume drink like my next
door neighbour's brother.
\paragraph
\noindent
The only reason that
people who think they are a reincarnated Jesus or a 
timetraveller get locked up in the psychiatric hospital is
that they blowhole about their experiences if
they keep their mouth shut they wouldn't get locked up.
What people in psychiatric hospitals who think they are Jesus
don't seem to realize is that they are not unique, we all have 
a little bit of Jesus in us, we are all reincarnations of him,
Sons \& Daughters of God.
\paragraph
\noindent
God possibly makes the world as complicated as we want it.
The last shall be first, the first last,
Plants may be conscious \& wise creatures in an alternate reality 
they do nothing all day except breathe \& take in nutrients, they 
don't overcomplicate life needlessly while Humans run around
in a rat race like headless chickens trying to get on.
Why was money ever invented if everybody just helped each other
there would be no need for it, no taxmen, accountants, tax advisers,
the legal profession.
\paragraph
\noindent.
Why want to live forever when you can die
peacefully \& return to the cosmic consciousness.
If you ever go off the side of a cliff in a dream you 
might be dying in an alternate reality, you sure as
hell waking up in a cold sweat.
You might also die peacefully every night when you go to sleep.
Moses may be 4000 years old in an alternate reality
\& doing fine.
\paragraph
\noindent
Most of the worlds peaceful major religions are relatively compatible,
well at least Christianity, Hinduism \& Buddhism.
However the commandment ``I am the lord your God
\& you shall not put strange Gods before me'' means
Christianity \& Judaism win out.
An interesting blasphemy which goes against this,
is that The New Testament is a fable written by
Matthew, Mark, Luke \& John \& as such is on
equal footing with The Lord of the rings,
a classic battle between good \& evil.
What happened if the bible was picked up around
300 AD by somebody in power who happened to
take the story too literally \& like the Pope
happened to like the story?.
Jesus was a Jew \& was circumcised.
Did Jesus marry Mary Magdalin?, I heard rumors he did. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Other Blasphemies, could Adam \& Eve
have been simpler lifeforms who decided to
overcomplicate their lives by eating an Apple
\& caused evolution of the species to start?.
Was Jesus a cold blooded alien lizard or a
yoga practitioner with excellent metabolism to
who could fake his own death on the cross.
Was the Virgin Mary artificially inseminated.    
\paragraph
\noindent
Germs, Viruses \& Diseases  
may only be a manifestation of fear in the Cosmic Consciousness
( the sum of all the Conscious beings in the Universe ), Bad Karma
caused by lack of faith in God, faith healers work
their Miracles improving Karma through faith,
Miracles happen every day, Life.
God doesn't work his miracles
if you don't love him, he is not pushy,
if you want something from him ask him nicely, pray,
God however will give you what you need even if it is
as Oprah Winfrey would say ``Tough Love', not what you want,
even if it is Death so God can take you to a happier place.
Patients survived with Florence Nightingale because
she was hygienic, really cared \& intelligent,
if there is blood \& guts flying all over the place
in unhygienic conditions patients are bound to get more
fear drilled into them \& as such would be less litely to survive.
If somebody tells you that leprosy is contagious \& 
you have been exposed to it or cancer is fatal \& you may 
be headwrecked by other people to believe you are fucked, you 
will die of fear owing to your body chemistry getting bad \& giving up.
\paragraph
\noindent
Likewise the hole in the Ozone, I believe if your faith in God is low
you are more likely to go looking for trouble \& may find it,
it's a Schrodinger's cat quantum mechanical type of thing,
things exist in a superposition of states till a conscious
observer observes it, that said if increased skin cancer
is observed people will go looking for the reason, ``The hole in the ozone'.
Greenpeace \& environmentalists are to a degree fearmongers 
if you learned physics chemistry \& maths \& got your facts right,
you would be amazed how many of you would become turncoats,
God wouldn't give
scientists the talent \& knowledge they have without good reason,
let destiny take it's course. People dying especially
of cancer often ask why me?, the reason is that God loves
you \& wants you to go to him in Heaven.
Let me give you an example,
some people think wave energy being completely safe 
\& environmentally friendly however as pointed out on 
slashdot recently this takes potential energy from the Moon which
will eventually collide with Earth almost certainly before the
sun runs out of fuel.
Admittedly Russia is doing a bad job at getting
rid of it's nuclear waste it can't afford
to get rid of it \& it can't afford not to.
People have been burning wood for millions of years,
We will adapt to the changing environment,
it is called evolution but maybe we can leave this planet
pretty much as it is once we get off it,
once we start using more atomic power the forests of
the Amazon can be saved, it is nice to look at
make this compromise pop environmentalists.
Animals running around near Chernobyl have increased cancer
resistance now admittedly I don't want to live there \&
wouldn't recommend my offspring to live there till their
cancer resistance has improved too.
Environmentalists go up against the U.S. they are obese
\& trying to eat the world they should adopt a more
German lifestyle it is quality not quantity which counts.
\paragraph
\noindent
Aids in my opinion cannot be cured at the moment,
the virus changes shape, morphs if you like,
genetic biologists can't handle it,
too much bad Karma in the World,
The researchers aren't cooperating with
each other fully, patents etc.
\& hedonists having sex with many partners without self discipline,
God probably doesn't mind people wearing condoms 
because he knows it is like sucking a sweet with the wrapper on,
\& nobody is making babies irresponsibly.
God gives people Aids because he loves them
he usually takes them straight to Heaven quickly
like Freddy Mercury the prostitute.
\section{Omens \& the dangers of taking them too seriously}
\paragraph
\noindent
I notice Omens especially when high,
this when I am high I believe is my little gift,
I shouldn't waste time with them but I do especially when high.
When high I believe omens are symbolic reminders left lying 
around by God e.g. music which
inspires me, muses, they get the mind to think of what
they remind me of, they  are full of original ideas on
what to do next, when high I believe they are quite useful,
but they usually are not.
So far hardly a single omen I have interpreted has come true,
this is the danger of them, maybe they work for some psychics
\& mystics but upto recently they have been for me nonsense,
God helped Feynman \& Einstein out too with omens
it is just they were a little too vain for all this luck to
become obvious to them.
Personally I am just a complete simpleton whom god has
inspired with a few good ideas.
I believe the writings of Nostradamus also as nonsense \&
vague enough so that you can make events match the prophecy's
with 20 20 hindsight.
That said it is quite possible that I just haven't been
patient enough for them to come true, maybe they are part
of a self fulfilling prophesy which I being master of
my own destiny make happen. 
My sister, believes she can tell if people are lying, I generally cannot, 
she doesn't believe it but reading people is beyond me especially
when I want to believe them,
this is why I spent \euro 80,000 on strippers, I thought they
genuinely liked me \& weren't liars.
Maybe people like Deanna Troy the empath from Star Trek exist,
we all may have our own X-Men Talents, my Omen reading
so far doesn't appear to be one of mine however when 
high I believe that it is.
My sister definitely is better at telling liars than me but
that said maybe my sister fools herself that she can
tell whether people are lying as a defense mechanism
so she can deal with her partner Ken more smoothly.
\paragraph
\noindent
The following 3 paragraphs contain a well argued intuitive case for Omens 
which actually make sense.
We have a female doberman an ABBA echo of the current state of my family,
when buying a pet everybody goes ``awwwwww'' \& picks the pet reflecting
their current state of mind,
shy, the doberman smells fear \& bad vibes from our family,
she is a sad reincarnation of Rupee our half ymuran half doberman, 
who now needs encouragement,
we got nervous, this is why Rupee who could walk on walls died,
lack of confidence she got poisoned by neighbours because 
our family were arguing
\& things were not running smoothly because we didn't trust each other,
bad Karma. We really need a lively Pomeranian like Rambo 
which we had as a child with a 
playful sense of humour at home to liven up the two depressed
dogs, Ethel \& the Doberman by biting them \& give them confidence
\& improve the Karma balance.
\paragraph
\noindent
Similar Omens which occurred to my family at the same time.
I \& my cousin got locked up in psychiatric wards,
my father \& his sister ( my cousins mother )
got sick with worry as a result,
my sister lost faith in her Volvo's, they kept breaking down, 
the logical reason for this was my sister 
must have been worrying, daydreaming \& driving on the half clutch,
we may all control the weather especially people doing a lot of pollution,
dark clouds might indicate the local state of Karma,
you always feel crap on a cloudy day or a day when the weather too hot,
could Mother Nature be involved in this Karma thing too?
\paragraph
\noindent
Sample Omens\\
Chardonnay is Vin de pays de doc ( Wine that pays the doctor ) 
my relaxer, unfortunately it causes me Hypomanic Episodes \& to 
go high as a kite,
I have to give it up for good, so much for that Omen.
Guinness is good for you, 
Beamish Stout makes you .... Beamish.
Lidl for Lidl people,
Wild Turkey whiskey is what you feed to 
greedy whiskey guzzlers once they see 
their greedy wild turkey jackass on the 
bottle they can't resist it \& 
can be kept from destroying other peoples lives
while lying on the ground shitfaced drunk.
If you believe in Omens you believe most things do exactly what 
they say on the Tin.
If you take Omens too seriously
you get into trouble like I did with my Chardonnay Omen.
\paragraph
\noindent
Below is a collection of some of the illogical linked Omens
that I was looking for significance in while high \& found some,
admittedly one can find coincidences anywhere when one looks hard 
enough for them.

Hi all,
George W. Bush Senior loves Oil.
I had a neighbour who had his White House burned down,
I think it's an Omen George \& stop burning 
the principles the White House was built on down.
Scientology I believe is a company posing as a religion to avoid tax 
started by a science fiction writer \& has sued people
for saying this, religions shouldn't sue people for slander.
Saddam Hussein has survived 30 coup attempts,
he is the ultimate survivor,
\& will kill his own family if they go against him.
He is really bad but in some ways nicer than George W. Bush.
Saddam may need to be the way he is to run a
messed up country like Iraq but he could
certainly take a few lessons from Kuwait.
he is a bad bastard \& damn good at being one.

\chapter{Exercises for nerds}
\paragraph
\noindent
If you are possibly unfit go to a doctor before starting
these exercises.
It won't do miracles for you chatting up women
but it may help your self esteem.
Three hours exercise a day is too much I recommend
a trying one hour a day rotating exercises, gyms are
for posers \& the equipment there won't get you really fit.
Flexibility I find is harder to gain than strength
so be patient with yourself.
Here is a list of the equipment you need.
\paragraph
\noindent
Books:\\
The beginners guide to Shokotan Karate by John Van Weenen.\\
Light on Yoga by BKS Evingar\\
available from \url{http://www.amazon.com}\\\\
Equipment:\\
A yoga mat.\\
2 Dumbells \& about 40kg of weights.\\
A children's playground nearby, watch kids
exercise you will get loads of ideas how to Jackie
Chan yourself fit, children's climbing frames are
great for chin ups \& inclined sit ups, the
best time to exercise is at 2am in the morning
when things are quiet.\\
A Karate jumpsuit.\\
A schoolbag sized rucksack.\\
A free solid wall in your house.\\
Togs runners \& T-shirts.
\paragraph
\noindent
The first exercise I recommend I call spidermen.
\paragraph
\noindent
Lie flat put your toes pointing downwards next to a wall,
straighten your arms like you would do if you were doing
a push up.
Now walk up \& down the wall keeping your back straight
\& at the top of the walk your nose should be touching
the wall, repeat 10 times.
\paragraph
\noindent
Lay the yoga mat flat near the wall folded over twice
in case you fall on your head attempting this exercise.
Stand up straight about 18 inches away from the wall
with your back facing the wall.
Bend over backwards \& attempt to walk down the wall
with your hands till they hit the floor.
From this position attempt to do 100 push ups away
from the wall, walk with your hands back up the
wall \& your finished
\paragraph
\noindent
When you get good at push ups try doing them with
1 leg raised off the ground \& finally proper one armed
press-ups to gain finger strength try reducing the number
of fingers you are using.
\paragraph
\noindent
Back bridges or crabs, lie on your yoga mat with your
heels as close as possible to your butt.
Put your hands with your palms of your hands
flat beside your ears, lift \& try to
get your forehead touching the ground, \& rock
backwards \& forwards, try to touch your nose
off the floor to do a crab push down with your
hands \& try to get your stomach as high as you can.
\paragraph
\noindent
To do sit-ups use the bottom of the bed to hold your feet
to stop them flying up into the air 
to secure your feet use a pillow if necessary,
or improvise with something else.
As a contrast to these try lying on your stomach on the ground
place your hands behind your back your palms near your butt
now try to lift your belly \& head as high as possible off the
ground without using your hands repeat 150 times.
\paragraph
\noindent
Try handstand push-ups against the wall, this requires getting into the
headstand position to do this push with your hands when
your head is on the ground, if you can't push up to a
handstand from the ground try getting into a handstand position
initially \& only dropping a small bit towards the headstand position.
Use a folded Yoga Mat under your head for safety \& comfort.
\paragraph
\noindent
Neck Strengthening exercise, this exercise sounds more dangerous
than it actually is
Again put the Yoga Mat under your head for safety \& comfort.
Do a headstand from there try to touch your two ears,
your forehead \& the back of your head off the mat.
Repeat 10 times.
\paragraph
\noindent
Leg strengthening exercise
Stand upright now put one leg straight out in front of yourself
while lowering yourself on the other leg,
get down as low as your can.
Now repeat with the opposite leg.
Repeat 10 times.
When you do this fast it turns into Cossack Dancing.
Enjoy.
\paragraph
\noindent
BackBends, kneel down in upright position,
try to bend over backwards to get your
head to touch the ground, come back up to upright position,
repeat 10 times.
\paragraph
\noindent
For a benchpress use your bed with a continental
quilt folded along the middle lie on the continental quilt
with your Dumbells on the bed. John Van Weenens Karate book
has plenty of exercises with weights.
\paragraph
\noindent
The books I recommended above have plenty of
more exercises for you to try.
\paragraph
\noindent
Most Karate classes are held in gyms so
there is probably plenty of equipment around
to practice Gymnastics, Somersaults on Trampolines,
Breakdancing or Capoiera....

\chapter{The Science Bit}
\paragraph
\noindent
Hopefully this section will get the nerds thinking.
\section{Where Science Fact is at compared to Science Fiction}
\paragraph
\noindent
The Internet is the greatest accelerator in the progression of
individuals acquiring knowledge since the invention of the printing press 
yet it was never envisaged by popular science fiction writers.
Sooner or later school will become obsolete \& people
will be acquiring \& distributing all their knowledge via the Internet.
The biggest problem won't be quantity of knowledge available
it will be quality. It will be interesting to see how
``google answers'' progresses.\\\\
The communications satellite has wildly exceeded
Arthur C. Clarke's 1948 groundbreaking expectations owing 
to miniaturization in electronics \& this occurred only
16 years after his initial prediction of it.\\\\
My Nokia 3650 mobile phone is nearly 3 years old \& has more
features than a Star Trek communicator.\\\\
Phasers with stun settings from Star Trek exist, soldiers guarding
nuclear power installations in the U.S. have them.\\\\
Lasers which can shoot missiles out of the sky exist.\\\\
Universal translators like on Star Trek exist.
have a look at \url{http://www.av.com translate}.\\\\
Common PC's now have speech recognition capabilities.\\\\
Space travel is where we are falling way behind
Star Trek so here is where I wish to push the boundaries.

\section{Going to Mars, The future of space travel}
Space Travel \& Aviation is where we aren't keeping up
with science fiction \& most definitely not improved much
in the last 40 years.
for this reason I am pushing out this benchmark.
I have grandiose thoughts \& I admit it is very much easier 
to talk the talk than walk the walk \& I like talk but
everybody thinks going to Mars \& back is much harder than going to the Moon.
There is one critical difference which makes it in some ways easier, Mars
has an atmosphere, jet engines will work there.
The downside is that the gravity on Mars is much higher than the Moon's,
this I suspect is why nobody has bothered to attempt to go to Mars yet.
Using existing rocket technology you would almost need to get a Saturn V to
Mars as the payload to get off the planet, seeing as the moon
has only 1/6 the gravity of earth the little Eagle Module was
enough to get off the Moon could you imagine trying to land
a Saturn V vertically on Mars so it could take off again. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Feynman first introduced the Rodger Ramjet idea of using an atomic powered
jet engine high in the Earth's atmosphere where it is very thin ( there
are nuclear submarines, why not atomic jet engines ) to reach 
escape velocity \& slingshot to Mars.
I suspect this idea was dumped because of it's environmental fallout
in the atmosphere when it was realized that atomic energy causes cancer,
hopefully this will change when curing cancer will be easier than
a common cold see the next topic below.
Ideally the scramjet should be using fusion as this
is environmentally friendly but this probably will be
impossible for another 50 years.
\paragraph
\noindent
The environmentally cleaner \& technically easier but more expensive
approach would be to use
a Saturn V to carry the atomic scramjet to Mars
( this of course is only environmentally cleaner if the Saturn V 
doesn't explode so for safety it would be best to choose some
remote desert like the Sahara ),
seeing as the atomic scramjet would now only have to work in Mars's
atmosphere \& not have to work in Earth's it would be easier to design.
It's unlikely but maybe some form of ``atomic catalytic converter'' 
could be invented to be used while operating in the Earths atmosphere 
to minimize radioactive emissions.
Also the upper atmosphere prevents cosmic rays maybe it
stop the gamma ray radiation too.
\paragraph
\noindent
To take off in the Martian atmosphere would be more difficult
that Earth's because the atmosphere is 100 times thinner,
this means a lot of speed would need to be picked up before
the scramjet \& aerodynamics could work,
maybe aerodynamic surfaces like wings should be avoided altogether if
the weight impact isn't offset by the usefulness of them.
for compactness in the design I
suggest to make a hybrid scramjet/rocket engine. When the
engine starts going initially it is a Rocket \& it gradually
changes from a rocket to a scramjet as it picks up speed
an adjustable diameter funnel to the air inlets may be needed
to get enough air into the scramjet while picking up speed
on Mars.
If we are using a Saturn V to launch the scramjet if desired
the fuel tank for the rocket propellant could be jettisoned once
the rocket gets going \& to be environmentally friendly the
atomic core in the scramjet could also be jettisoned when the scramjet
leaves the Martian atmosphere if the environmentalists want
it that way. The great thing about an atomic 
scramjet is it needs to carry no propellant except for a bit
of radioactive material \& the bit of propellant to operate
while in rocket mode it should I would hope only weigh about as much
as the Eagle Module which landed on the moon, hopefully
the oxygen for the crew doesn't add too much extra weight but
I suspect it would to last the many weeks the trip will take,
( could somebody invent something to recycle oxygen if it doesn't
already exist ).
It should be easy to get a unmanned small manless scramjet 
Mars for initial testing, an average sized rocket should do.
\paragraph
\noindent
A very sensitive long range radar \& an autopilot with
the ability to make minute course adjustments
under computer control may be needed to avoid
space debris which would be lethal at such high speeds,
I would aim for 100,000 miles an hour so not so much oxygen
is needed for the crew.
The ship should have rebreather as used by some
scuba divers \& in astronaut space suits devices which 
recycle the air only replacing the used
oxygen in the air or ideally something better
descriptions of these devices can be found at
\url{http://www.rebreather.com/techlayout.html}
\url{http://science.howstuffworks.com/question632.htm}
\paragraph
\noindent
I would like the ship to be made as much as possible from
one solid piece of material \& be flexible enough change shape naturally
as aerodynamic stresses are applied to it. 
I personally don't like things that vibrate
vibrations typically cause things to break, for moving parts I like
things that go round \& round like turbines they don't break much.
\paragraph
\noindent
Videos of Alien abductions is the place to look for ideas for spaceships.
The more observant people will describe their experiences
accurately. An interesting concept from a video I watched
points the future for materials science, the materials
blended into each other without joints.
Anybody who watch ``Das boot'' knows that rivets pop
in World War II U-Boats at 250 meters \& glued Space
Shuttle heat shield tiles keep falling off not to mention O rings
which caused the 1984 Challenger space shuttle disaster,
Joints are from an engineering point of view bad ideas.
\paragraph
\noindent
Dynamic blends of material need to be made, blending smoothly
into each other, I suggest making alloys/dynamic blends of
titanium, carbon fiber, plastic, glass, fiberglass \& the ceramics
in space shuttle heat shields.
\paragraph
\noindent
To prevent loss of life the initial prototypes will be radio
controlled \& I hope John Mc Carmac would be interested in
writing the autopilot software to land the spaceship on Mars.
Owing to fifteen minute delays caused by radio waves getting to Mars \& back
the distance from Earth would be too far to land by remote control 
I also would hope that Scaled Composites could be made interested. 
I personally hope Ryanair will be flying there
in 20 years for \euro5,999 provided atomic scramjets are allowed
operate in the Earths atmosphere.
\paragraph
\noindent
More propellant can be got while flying by
taking in some from the air intake of the
scramjet before leaving the atmosphere.
\paragraph
\noindent
The propellant tank on the
scramjet should ``integrate'' the flow
of propellant in and out through small
valves. It should always be a scramjet
but be designed more like an atomic rocket.
The scramjet may still work in space somewhat
if there is traces of gas around \& if travelling
at a few million miles an hour.
\paragraph
\noindent
If some of the scramjet is made in Russia
maybe the Uranium 235 in some of the decommissioned
nuclear warheads can be used as fuel for the scramjets.
A parachute would make a good airbrake I would suggest
making the parachute in the scramjet
plane out of a strong metal capable of standing high
temperatures \& possibly with hinges
so it naturally packs away neatly,
but maybe a metal fabric is better.
How fast can a scramjet theoretically go?,
can it do a small percentage of the 
speed of light in 100 years or so?
If so Alpha Centuari may be within reach.
I've heard that the blood can be taken out
of a dog \& replaced by some kind of saline
solution for a few hours, could this
be done for a few years so we don't age while travelling?
How hard would it be to make a protective magnetic
field to prevent cosmic rays once we get outside
the Val Allen Belt.
\paragraph
\noindent
I love Russian Tu-144 jets,
they were made of primitive technology \& were
300 miles an hour faster than Concorde.
I think the Russians should build the ``silver dream machine',
to keep control of finances the CEO of Ryanair Michael O' Leary,
this tyrant would make sure the job
gets done for a song. I would like the other space agencies
to get involved too but if the heat is too hot stay out of the
kitchen. Like John F. Kennedy setting the goal for the
landing on the Moon I am going to set a goal for
getting to Mars, 3 to 5 years time, see my open letter to Bob Geldof
Richard Branson \& others if you want to see how I hope
this will be achieved.

\section{Space Elevators}
\paragraph
\noindent
Arthur C. Clarke I suspect you like space elevators
because you like thing in geosynchronous orbit like
your communications satellites.
What happens if some small fast moving projectile
in outer space collides with them, here is my suggestion.
Make the elevator cable flexible \& put small retrorockets
every kilometer on them to move the cables out of
the way if some space debris is on a collision course
with them.
I think the things would only be good for launching
probes \& satellites nobody wants a 22,000 mile
trip on your Greyhound bus going at 60 miles an
hour.
The space elevator also should have 2 tracks 1 up
1 down \& the carriages switch over on the
track when they go to the top or the bottom,
this would allow loads of carriages to
go up \& down simultaneously.
Arthur C. Clark I know you love this technology
\& will love this it can be used to launch
more communication satellites. If our
Nokia phones are to work all the way to Mars
we will need loads of Microwave Phone Cells
to be launched, the space elevator
can launch these by the thousand.

\section{Cures for cancer}
Some cancers can be cured by a virus, see
\url{http://www.onoclyticsbiotech.com} for more info.
Surely this is the way to go as opposed to chemotherapy.
How about some preventative medicine imagine if children
were immunized against cancer before they got it or
even having the virus put into the foodchain atomic
power would become quite safe.
As Kristian Walsh pointed out radiation causes more
damage than just cancer the question I ask is this
damage acceptable. It would also be worth
researchers while to figure out why the animals
living near Chernobyl are surviving \& make use of
the information.

\section{Fountains of youth are starting to appear}
There are substitutes for youth.
Good anti wrinkle skincare products may not be all they
are cracked up to be but 
hormone replacement therapy allegedly can take 20 years off
older people. Hormones tell the body when it is
getting old HRT tells it a lie.
Hormone replacement therapy doesn't replace hormones
it supplements whats already there.
There was a recent aging process breakthrough
that may one day allow people to live much longer lives.
It only works on yeast at the moment it lowers the
metabolism of yeast by knocking out the Sir2 \& Sch9 genes
\& causes it to live 6 times longer, the next step
is to prolong the life of mice see
\url{http://www.gaurdian.co.uk/science/story/0,3605,1645418,00.html}
for more info. I would suspect that lowering
humans metabolism like this would have serious side effects.


\section{Spacesuits}
These wouldn't be necessary for the mission to Mars but
if we manage to mitigate the cosmic rays
causing cancer problem by the anti cancer virus
in the future how about Spacesuits rather than 
weighing around 650lbs instead made so tight
they prevent the body exploding owing to pressure 
outside the suit, these would not need atmospheric pressure 
built up inside them \& be more like high altitude skydiving suits.
The only thing I am not sure about is whether the spacesuit
could be made to have insulation properties \& have heating
equipment installed to survive the temperature extremes of space.

\section{Matter antimatter energy}
If you think Nuclear Energy is powerful,
compared to matter antimatter energy it
is very inefficient. Matter antimatter energy
makes 100\% efficent use of Einstiens
\begin{math} 
E=mc^{2} 
\end{math}
equation.
At present it is very difficult to get
ones hands on antimatter because it reacts
instantaneously with matter; we can only
generate about few thousand atomic sized antimatter particles
at a time in Particle accelerators like the
ones in CERN at the Swiss French Border.
We would need to go to a very special place
in the Universe to find this stuff existing 
in abundance.
An antimatter bomb would have 0Kg critical mass,
it would probably be undetectable, no radiation.

\section{Making an atomic bomb}
This is very difficult to do even if you can
get your hands on 11kg of Uranium (it's critical mass).
The difficult bit is as you try to push 11kg of
Uranium together it tries to blow apart as it is
beginning to explode.
The most likely weapon a terrorist would try to
make is a dirty bomb, a normal bomb wrapped
in a dirty radioactive material which the blows
the radioactive material over an area.

\section{Getting rid of Nuclear waste}
Greenpeace in my opinion are fear mongers they should be lobbying to
get nuclear fusion going rather than fighting with scientists
doing their best with nuclear fission reactors.
Stop dropping nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea,
why not drop it into volcanoes?,
Nuclear waste is much denser than lava or magma
\& should sink to the centre of the earth where
it is completely safe.
I came across this idea in the BBC's Focus magazine of October 2005.
But it was pointed out that this idea is dangerous.
Who are they fooling?, what happens in 10,000 years
when the cases no holding nuclear deposits at the bottom
of the sea erode.
I think the idea hasn't been tested \& what
we are dealing with here is fear of the unknown \&
like fear of the dark should be overcome by
people in power to make these decisions.
If people don't want to live near a volcano which
is being used as a nuclear waste dump why are
you living near a volcano in the first case,
you are defying God anyway by never expecting the thing
to blow, move to a safer place, live away from volcanoes.
Likewise people who live near any other potential disaster zone
wise up \& stop defying God, he really doesn't want you living there.
Mother Nature doesn't like being fought against \& usually wins.
Biodegradable plastic bags are terrible they fall to millions of bits
if you use them to hold stuff in them for a few years \& 
the mess they make needs to be vacuumed up,
to be environmentally friendly things need
to be made of high quality \& as reusable as possible not
the other way around. 

\section{Walking on water}
It should be possible to walk on water like Jesus
did or more precisely run on water. Lizards do
it all the time. All thats needed is some
fluid dynamics engineer to design flippers 
to do this feat, I suspect it will be the biggest
fad since the Rubik cube.
Blasphemy time, it is possible that Jesus
may be a showoff alien lizard 
``Come on Peter, this walking on water is really easy'' 
with webbed feet?.
In any case I suspect you would need to be really 
fit to do it.

\section{Opencyc}
This is a project to give computers common sense
\url{http://www.opencyc.org} in my opinion this project
shouldn't be using plain English. It should be
using a hybrid language based on
Latin ( an old very mathematical language )
\& Esperanto ( it takes two hours to learn the grammar ),
to enhance things no words should have multiple
meanings, nothing irregular or special cases
\& all words should sound different to
enhance speech recognition. Also
objects should be described physically \& unambiguously.
Having a unambiguous language will mean Politicians
can no longer twist words \& corny jokes will
be eradicated from the face of the Earth.
Also Bono \& company would have problems getting 
their songs to rhyme.
Opencyc should also be programmed with a knowledge
of physics \& chemistry so it can make more intelligent
judgments than people, it should know various things
like the periodic table of elements \& the decay
statistics of various radioactive elements.
Also the boiling \& melting points of various liquids
at various pressures \& the watts generated per KG
of various radioactive elements.
If you think this is hard have a look at various
maths packages like Derive from Texas Instruments
\& Mathematica these are better at Maths than most of
the Mathematicians I know. I think that Opencyc
will never make it to having full common sense \& probably
will be a perpetual work in progress. I also think it
would be much better off as a tracked robot with senses.
I hate robots that walk it is human egomania \&
vanity that nature is able to do better control
engineering balancing an unstable object than engineers,
the only reason we got legs instead of tracks is that you can't
grow skin over tracks.
\paragraph
\noindent
The proliferation of languages overcomplicated everything  \&
held up the development of science
from the Greek heydays around 500BC till the
medieval ages \& the printing press got going.
The Greek philosophers, scientists \& mathematicians all had it easy 
they all just spoke... Greek, they had to waste no time \& energy
learning extra languages. Another serious
setback which stopped progress in science was the burning of the library
in Alexandria around 700AD, this probably removed
half the body of knowledge in the world at the time,
as any good computer engineer knows always make backups.
The poor philosophers, scientists \& mathematicians in
the medieval days needed around 5 languages, the poor
philosopher, scientist or mathematician who was no
good at languages could get nowhere as he couldn't
understand the books. I personally despite doing an
electronics degree find modern mathematical
documentation hieroglyphic \& nearly impossible to understand,
has anybody ever thought of doing away with some of it.
Or at least do two versions of every book one concise one
for people who can deal with mathematic hieroglyphs one
for people who can't or else somebody invest some energy
to make maths easier for people with problems with languages.
\paragraph
\noindent 
People interested in science \& mathematics should have the option of opting
out of learning languages beyond internationally agreed basics \& people 
interested in Culture should have the option of
opting out of Science \& Mathematics except for the basics.
Why do school curriculums insist on ramming stuff down students throats
that they have no interest in?, let the kids do what they want.
If everybody in the world learned this simple Latin/Esperanto
hybrid language we could all communicate with each other \& with machines. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Has Opencyc tried Turing test?, the test to see if it behaves
lifelike. Buggy software behaves more lifelike, neural
nets are the right idea.
Interoperability between modules is very important
I recommend Corby interfaces, hitch up
speech synthesizer \& speech recognition
software to Opencyc \& the derive maths package.
\paragraph
\noindent
Better than HAL 2001 Space Odyssey may
be around the corner.
Opencyc has to be able to move \& observe
to learn about the world for itself.
It should be able to be tought like
a child \& allowed to watch the Teletubbies
it is important possibly for speech recognition
\& visual development maybe.
It should use image processing software
to figure out what a ball is \& learn
by giving it examples.
\paragraph
\noindent
Wisdoms from writing Opencyc should be
written down in a book, what you did
right what you did wrong \& distributed
like my book so the next generation attempt
can be started by some other enthusiastic lot.
Rather than making a Corba interoperability
module an other more hack alternative is
available.
how about making Opencyc have a mouse
interface, keyboard interface \& a graphics
screen with got text recognition software.
That way it would be able to drive programs
like the Maths Package derive once tought.
\paragraph
\noindent
How about GPS based route planning software
be used so it can travel independently
between different towns.
Maybe Microsoft can help out by allowing
hitching into their GUI font managers etc.
directly to so that Opencyc can figure out
more accurately what is being printed on the screen.
\paragraph
\noindent
A CD/DVD jukebox would be a good idea.
There are a few good Japanese developers
making robots that try to mimic
humans a bit too much get the ones
doing potentially useful things.
The robot I am considering
doesn't have a smiley or surprised face
yet \& if it does it is only
software that renders on a computer
monitor when absolutely needed,
this screen will be of a lot of use
for other things too a picture
can tell 1000 words.
\paragraph
\noindent
The machine will be able to run
For the moment Linux,MacOSX \& Windows simultaneously
probably have 3 processors.
I want every bit of useful best of breed software
on the planet able to run on it \& all the programmers
on the project can play to their strengths rather than 
having to learn a new operating system.
\paragraph
\noindent
Theorem provers will be useful,
so will wifi, Ethernet \& dial up phone jacks.
The computer will have full email \& web access,
any question it doesn't know the answers for
it puts a reward on google answers for it.
\paragraph
\noindent
There is an interesting piece of software called Alice.
\url{http://www.alicebot.org} which
is a piece of software which makes
smalltalk, this may be useful.
\paragraph
\noindent
We will use the babelfish language translation
engine including webpage translation
\& a new simplified English which will
be Opencyc's native tongue. We will get
MS Words Grammar Engine developer \& tap
him for his wisdoms on language development
also the developers of babelfish for advise
on simplified English.
Web access from www.weather.com \& map24.com
will be important.
Facial Recognition \& face emotion 
\& body language recognition software
will also be important so the
software can work out ``what is wrong'
with people.
My project fundamental should also
be part of Opencyc.

\section{String Theory}
Apologies quantum physicists the arguments in this section 
are not based on any knowledge of string theory whatsoever \& 
as such should be considered unlike my other ideas, the ideas of a quack.
'Maya is the beauty that hides the reality.',
\& as Einstein said ``It must be beautiful', he played violin,
that is why God inspired him. 
I admit it is extremely unlikely but 
String theory may be about music, there are possibly 42 dimensions
in the Universe, Douglas Adams, God has a sense of humour.
There are twelve notes in an octave, seven in a scale,
could the dimensionless constant 2 to the power of 1/12 = 1.059463094
the multiplier between the frequencies of semitones
be of significance?
Sing at nature \& it sings back at you, God loves all art.
God loves Michael Jackson, God loves all art.
Musicians may be string theory technicians.
\paragraph
\noindent
God may make the Universe as complex or as simple as we want it. 
I saw another omen a Can of Lynx Dimension Deodorant with
24-7 written on it \& curled up dimensions ( spirals ),
A lot of Yoga is about gently massaging the bodies
internal organs, listening to good music through 
a sub woofer does the same thing.
Cats purr because the vibrations make their bones
harder, this music increases lifeforce thing appears to be genuine.
\paragraph
\noindent
You are as old as you feel, Bono still feels 18 \& is getting
lifeforce from people who are feeding him at U2 concerts,
it's improving his body chemistry, I played in
a band when I was young \& I know
there are only two places you can die happy,
on stage playing to an appreciative audience \& having great sex.
You get old when you get knocked by life \& fail to
get up. One person who tried to knock Bono down 
a lot in his life oddly enough was his father. 
Thankfully Bono is giving back lifeforce at his concerts.
Look at Yoko Ono she is around 70 \& looks 40
because she is loved by John Lennon fans,
she probably still can have babies.
My father knew a man Noel Tanner who at 95 still hunted horses.
Sing to nature \& it sings back to you this is how I believe
lifeforce is created.

\section{The future of Dentistry}
I hate Dentists that pull teeth they are only
trying to make you ugly, however getting your
teeth cleaned by a dentist is great.
Stem cell research is going places
In two years time approximately you will be able
to get teeth grown from stem cells which
are implanted in your gums.
My mother never got me to brush my teeth as a
child as a result I am missing about 8 molars,
they were removed by Dentists \& I was pissed off by that.
This is my chance to get them back :-).

\section{SNAP Batteries}
I did a bit of research to find out why they still use
heavy primitive technologies like lead acid batteries 
in electric cars \& those awful over complications of 
hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius. Why not SNAP
( Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power ) batteries.
These are atomic batteries typically used to power satellites,
they work by converting the heat generated when a radioactive
substance decays into heat.
They are so safe they can even be used in heart pacemakers.
They can generate 30 Watts per KG this means the battery
for a 10 horsepower car would be 250Kg,  damn I thought
it would be much better than that, it's nearly
is as bad as a lead acid battery but I've got an idea,
you only need a lot of power when going up a hill
or accelerating this is at most only for a few minutes,
1 horsepower is quite adequate most of the time,
this reduces the battery weight to 25Kg \&
the SNAP battery can charge up a high wattage lithium
ion battery or a capacitor for when extra power is needed.
The main advantage of SNAP batteries lasts 
around 150 years before it got half discharged.
Also Plutonium 238 need to make the batteries 
costs around \$700 a gram... expensive.
To make an ideal SNAP battery for high power usage
we need a source of alpha particles with a shorter 
half life than 150 years which doesn't decay into
anything too dirty  ( 10 years is my idea of an ideal
figure, longer if this generates too much heat ).
The hard part is if it's half
life if its only 10 years it will be very rare naturally so
it will need to be made artificially, in a nuclear reactor possibly
\& ideally can be made cheaply which it probably can't.

\section{Breathing}
Sorry I couldn't research this better.
Did you know that there is a liquid which
people can breathe I saw it on tomorrows world a few years ago.
Would this stuff stay in craters in the moon without boiling off
\& would the liquid be able to store heat from the sun
to be possible for people to live in it?
If this was more dense than water we could also use it
to live at the bottom of shallow lakes \& do
farming or mining down there.

\section{Bees flying}
I heard that Bee's flying cannot be explained by the
laws of aerodynamics, so when I was high I came up
a cockeyed theory that it was due to antigravity
gyroscopic effects owing to their wings flapping
quickly. I though this would get us to the stars
at almost the speed of light using an ion rocket.
I have been since corrected by Kristian Walsh
the aerodynamic correction was owing to vortices
forming around the hairs on their backs.
Thanks for the info Kristian.

\section{Economics, Money \& Investing}
Economics is a madmade \& as such is an inexact science.
I would be interested to know if an economist can explain away how Ryanair can
offer flights for \euro1 \& still make a profit.
The Ryanair CEO Michael O' Leary understands headwrecking \& bargaining power.
Bob Hopes way of getting rich was to buy land at the edge of town,
\& expect the town eventually to grow \& thus require his land.
Warren Buffett ( Buffettology is an excellent book )
has no plans, he has no idea what company he is going to buy tomorrow
but also understands the realities of economics.
He just chooses stocks of good companies that he likes,
works out accurately what they are worth,
\& just waits till the companies stock price falls well
below this critical value \& then buys.

\section{Nanotechnology}
Nanotechnology is Biology, God invented it
billions of years ago, stop reinventing the wheel.

\section{My Theory of how Bioenergy healing works}
Ollie Cahill has a friend of mine has an aunt who did some hocus pocus
on him which gave him an almercyful pain in his stomach.
My guess on how this works is the following.
She charged up with static electricity by rubbing her feet on
the floor. After doing this for a while she generated
a few low frequency photons, an electromagnetic shockwave
by pushing her hands quickly forward.
This hit Ollies nerves on his skin near his stomach giving
him a shock.
\section{My Theory of how water divining works}
My brother James successfully did some water divining
using a welding rod for a broken water mains.
This I guess worked by dipoles in the water molecules
being aligned \& spiralling outwards at the leak,
the copper pipe acted as a Faraday cage preventing
water inside the pipe generating a magnetic field.
The leak thus acted as a electromagnet attracting the
welding rod with the magnetic field.
\section{Is Maths beautiful enough as it is?}
Maths is beautiful enough, I like
hypotheses they are right most of the
time \& this is good enough,
they should be put into Mathematica
\& checks put in so they can be automatically
dealt with when they go wrong. Physics
\& programmers have been dealing with
an inexact science for years mathematicians
should do likewise.
Godel's undecidability theorem basically states that
not all things true in mathematics can
be proved using mathematics,
it is like a bishop on a chessboard not being
able to get to all the squares.
Hypotheses which have passed the
test of time \& not been proven
false have to be assumed as more
or less correct stop wasting
time \& start going with them
mathematicians. I don't know
if this is possible but try making
theorems for provability \& 
start trying to check if things
are provable or not.
\paragraph
\noindent
The guy who cracked Fermat's last
theorem is wasted
a lot of time on something that
everybody in their right mind knew
was true for 500 years. If he didn't
invent new maths for his efforts
I would have hit him.
\paragraph
\noindent
\section{Getting Rare Elements}
It may be possible to send metal ``scoops'' with very high
melting points through the Suns atmosphere to pick up valuable 
rare materials e.g. radioactive elements with short half lifes.
These scoops can be emptied out once they have been passed through
the other side of the suns atmosphere.
\section{Environmental Issues}
If dumping is tidied up German Style,
Landfills each specializing in one type of substance
are the mines of the future, specialized dumps
can be made environmentally friendly because
there are only a few risks associated with
each substance which can be overcome properly.
An international web based freely accessible archive needs to be kept of 
what is dumped where \& needs to be kept for future generations.
Even the depleted nuclear waste from nuclear reactors like Sellafield
kept under the Irish Sea may be of use to someone
creative enough even now.
\chapter{Random Thoughts}
What if God really created the world in 7 days
around the start of human history around 20,000BC
\& just left evidence like fossils, light from
distant stars, \& the cosmic background microwave
radiation to convince us that the universe is
much older.\\\\
Magic is science in an alternate reality.\\\\
Try walking around the place with the wind at your
back it is interesting where God will take you.\\\\
Everything has a personality humans use
it for self expression, sunglasses have
a cool personality.\\\\
People who turn into vegetables after taking LSD
possibly die in an alternate reality.\\\\ 
The body is an imperfect decaying representation
of the spirit/soul which rejuvenates when you go to Heaven.\\\\
Most homeopathic medicines possibly use the placebo effect,
if people believe they will work they will,
that said I would use homeopathic medicine before 
I would use rat poison to thin my blood.\\\\
DNA loses the bits off the end each time it
reproduces a copy of itself, is this why we
get old?, can the bits on the ends get stuck back on.\\\\
Why is Planck mass so large compared to the mass of
the electron while the other Planck constants are so small?\\\\
Alcoholism, Drug Abuse \& Suicidal Tendencies
are symptoms not the problem they are caused
by people being self destructive \& wanting to be saved.\\\\
\chapter{Open letter to Gerry Ryan, Bob Geldof, Bill Gates, Bono,\\
Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Eddie Jordan, Richard Branson,\\
Burt Ru tan John Mac Carmac, Paul Allen \& Michael Jackson}
\paragraph
\noindent
Bill Gates I know you love Richard Feynman, so do I.
I know love Porches \& the film The Clockwork Orange
my favourite film is Dangerous Liaisons it's better
any interest in a Dangerous Liaison with me?
Bill you are worth more than the GDP of many countries
Why not give half your money to Africa \&
your kids won't be spoilt if they
learn the value of money, stop overprotecting them.
You can put some of the rest of it in the Mission to
Mars Project, you will still be a billionaire 
many times over anyway \&
still worth more than the GDP of many countries.
What the hell do you want it all for anyway?, you can't
take it with you when you die.
\paragraph
\noindent
Bob Geldof, Bono, Michael Jackson how would you
like to hold a leg of Live Aid 2 from Mars.
Michael Jackson you are a nice guy but
you care too much what people think of you
I suspect this is why you had all the plastic
surgery. I heard you were interested in meeting
Martians, we can make the guys who go up in the
scramjet I suggested citizens of Mars, would that
do you?
\paragraph
\noindent
Larry Ellison I know you love MIGS what do
you think of my Bat out of hell idea would
you like to go up?
The Scramjet if aerodynamics works for it may perform
like a fighter except be much faster to get you home from Mars
in time for tea, the atomic engine should last
at least quite a while flying inside the Mars atmosphere 
\& we can put an autopilot on it so you can sleep \& you only
have to come home when you get bored.
Steve Jobs have any interest in dropping the rollerblades \& going up.
What about you Richard?
Eddie Jordan have you any interest in organizing the advertising?
The only thing I would like painted on the thing myself is a Swastika
with a Star of David next to it symbolizing peace between
Germans \& Jews \& possibly a bit of Graffiti.
Gerry Ryan can you get Bob Geldof, Bono \& Cmdr. Collins
that NASA Astronaut who recently went up on the Space Shuttle
whom you interviewed recently going so he can get NASA interested,
\& make Live Aid2 a reality.  
\paragraph
\noindent
Bill I know you are interested in beating Linux at
it's own game, here is what you do... support Cygwin.
You can already run nearly all the Linux apps on Windows.
Steve Jobs has got Linux engineers flying to MacOS X
in droves because there are about 50 gui's on Linux
hardly any of them any good except KDE. Windows is safe
your users don't want the headache of learning Linux.
KDE boys your software is far too expensive on Windows.
why don't you make your software MYPL
'pay us what you think the software is worth',
for more details on how to do this go to my website
\url{http://www.ariasoft.ie/gplcontributions.html}.
In an ideal world everything should be under MYPL even food.
If KDE is any good people will pay you for it rather
than see it die. I personally hope that all the open
source GUI developers will stop reinventing the wheel
\& go with KDE \& give us a consistent interface for Linux.
Bill I think all software should be sold under MYPL
All my software is officially under GPL but
unofficially I hope to be paid for it. I am a communist
rather than a capitalist unlike yourself who likes
haggling, I couldn't be arsed running around looking
for money off people who really don't want to give it to me
possibly because they don't think my software is much good anyway
\& chasing ``software pirates'' it wastes too much energy.

Feynman's Lectures in physics,
These were published in 1965 \& are the physics
books that will be used in the leaving cert in Ireland, high school in the US,
A levels in England when Star Trek is a reality.
Hopefully people in charge of school curriculum will take my advise
\& make this a reality now, they should be used when the students
are 14 till they are 19 as a subject taught an hour a day
they take about 3 years to learn in school.
I was 30 when I discovered these books,

\chapter{Open letter to George W. Bush, Al Jizera,
Gerry Adams, Oprah Winfrey, Pope Benedict, Saddam Hussein,
Tom Cruise, John Travolta \& the Jews,
my twopence worth on politics}
\paragraph
\noindent
\textit{\\}
Hi all,\\
\paragraph
\noindent
Scientology I believe is a company posing as a religion to avoid tax 
started by a science fiction writer \& has sued people
for saying this, religions don't sue people for slander.
\paragraph
\noindent
I am not Anti American or anyone else for that matter.
I've met nice people from all walks of life.
I take a lot of potshots at George W. in this letter
it's nothing personal, I just think his policies are
very seriously flawed, I strongly suspect he has his own
hidden agendas \& any sane person is very
likely to agree with me.
\paragraph
\noindent
George W. wasn't elected president of America for his
first term in office, certain demographic groups
in Florida who voted for Al Gore were discounted.
George was helped by his brother Jeb, the Governor
of Florida. John Ellis first cousin of George W. Bush
ran Fox News Network's ``decision desk'' during
the 2000 election \& Fox was the first to
name Bush the winner.  
\paragraph
\noindent
Saddam Hussein has survived 30 coup attempts,
he's a survivor,
\& will kill his own family if they go against him,
is George W. Bush better?
The Bushs love Oil, they go to war for it.
Saddam may need to be the way he is to run a
messed up country like Iraq, however, but he could
certainly take a few lessons from Kuwait.
Saddam has the guts to shoot a man himself,
the Bushs just get others to do their dirty work,
American \& British soldiers just following orders, wake up!,
Saddam deserves more respect than Bush does,
he will dirty his own hands.
History is complicated if you examine it
there is a lot of double dealing 
\& incestuous behavior going on, America
has a habit of doing whatever serves it's
best interest moment to moment.
In the 1980's Donald Rumsfeld you shook Saddam's hand,
opened an American Embassy in Iraq \& gave him 
``weapons of mass destruction'' to kill
Iranians during the Iran Iraq war out of
fear of fundamentalism. It also gave weapons
\& CIA training to Bin Laden in Afghanistan
to fight them damn commies.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia gave Saddam money
to do their dirty work during the Iran Iraq war 
\& Kuwait had the nerve to ask a bankrupt Iraq
for the money back after the war, no wonder
Saddam invaded Kuwait, they really ticked him off.
How can we be lovers if we can't make amends,
how can we be lovers if the fighting never ends.
\paragraph
\noindent
Any kind of ``ism'' is born out of ignorance \& fear,
nationalism is a sin, it is
``Pride in the name of love'' the biggest sin of all,
Martin Luther King... tell Bono.
Sinne Fianna Fail, Gerry Adams for Irish president, united Ireland.
Oprah Winfrey for American President,
Oprah if you think you are not the woman for the job
ask yourself do you seriously think you would do a 
worse job than George W. . Make me a sinner,
proud to be Irish, vote with me!
\paragraph
\noindent
The Star Of David is a Swastika, ask any Palestinian.
\paragraph
\noindent
I believe Karma exists, so does empathy, you reap what you sow,
what you give out to the World comes back to you with interest,
treat people like crap \& watch what happens when they get fed up of you.
George W. your lust for oil caused the Twin Towers,
Bin Laden your non functioning kidneys, maybe you deserved them.
Osama, there were no virgins waiting in Heaven for the edjits you
got to crash into the Twin Towers.
Saddam look at the fine mess you got yourself into.
George W. why did you fly all of Bin Laden's family
out of the U.S. while all the rest of the planes
in the U.S. were grounded immediately after the 
Twin Towers disaster?. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Pope Benedict why do you drive in a bulletproof car?, don't you trust God?
Why is the Vatican so wealthy don't you know it is easier
for a rich man to get through the Eye of a Needle than
into Heaven.
\paragraph
\noindent
Al Jizera why don't you do an English
version of the news \& give some balanced
reporting on the European \& U.S. satellite
systems. We need something
other than propaganda. The media
is messing with the heads of Americans
by intermittently telling them there is danger
of an imminent terrorist attack \& next day
there isn't, this headwrecking would give
anybody a mental breakdown.
Isn't it amazing that the Twin Towers
got more news coverage than the millions
of people who lost their lives recently
in Pakistan, the St. Stephens Tsunami Disaster
, the New Orleans flood \& the millions of innocent Iraqis
who have died of cancer owing to George W. Bush
allowing the use of depleted Uranium anti
tank weapons in Iraq, these people have received no
news coverage whatsoever in the western World,
well done George.\\\\

D.J. Barrow.

he will still be a billionaire anyway \& survive the ``cash rape''.
Make an agreement between Bill \& Bono that if Bono
is man enough to give away 75\% of his wealth Bill will
match it with 99\% they are both stinking rich from my perspective,
lets see if these two really deserved the awards bestowed on them.
\paragraph
\noindent
Bono if you do this like Muhammad Ali you will hammer a lot of respect
into a lot of people, especially politicians looking after their
own backs, by putting your money where your
mouth is you won't need to be wearing shades to be cool,
it certainly will do more for your credibility than making headlines 
by fighting a silly woman in court over a silly \$200 dollar stetson hat.
Don't get me wrong Live Aid \& Live 8 were fantastic
but there is a certain pretentiousness in some almost billionaire
pop stars getting the common man to part with their money
without parting with some of their own.
\paragraph
\noindent
Bill what the hell do you want the money for anyway?,
a safety net in case you go broke?, power?, you can't
take it with you when you die \& you can't eat it
if you go hungry, it's useless,
how can your kids ever learn the value of money
in the neverland detached from reality you have them living in,
you would need to give away 99.999\% get them be
as grounded as your average Joe Soap.
Bob while you are at it sting
the Bushs for some of their personal wealth I'll
bet Michael Moore can calculate their worth to the penny,
if they are slow parting with their money take them to
Africa \& Iraq for a wake up call \& to see the fine mess
they are making of the place there.
\paragraph
\noindent
Bob make sure the money gets to the people most deserving of it
\& that the money doesn't go into some African dictator's hands. 
\paragraph
\noindent
Bob Geldof, Bono, Michael Jackson how would you
like to hold a leg of Live Aid 2 from Mars.
Michael Jackson you are a nice guy.
I heard you were interested in meeting
Martians, we can make the guys who go up in the
scramjet citizens of Mars, would that do you?
\paragraph
\noindent
Larry Ellison I know you love MIGs would you pay
to fly the scramjet?  how much are you willing to pay
help make it happen?, I don't think you would have
the patience for the Mars trip so would some
test flights around Earth do you?
Richard Branson, Burt Rutan any interest in coming closer
to living up to the name Virgin Galactic?
Michael O' Leary CEO of Ryanair have you any interest in keeping
control of finances to make sure the job gets done cheaply?,
Eddie Jordan have you any interest in organizing the advertising?
The only thing I would like painted on the thing myself is a small Swastika
with a Star of David next to it symbolizing peace between
Germans \& Jews.
Gerry Ryan, Dave Fanning can you get Bob Geldof, Bono \& Cmdr. Collins
the NASA Astronaut who recently went up on the Space Shuttle
whom you interviewed recently going so he can get NASA interested,
\& make Live Aid2 a reality.
\paragraph
\noindent
I love Russian Tu-144 jets,
they were made of primitive technology \& were
300 miles an hour faster than Concorde.
If the craft is being built by private enterprise
it would be cheapest to build it in Russia.
While the Americans have their spaceships
in the Smithsonian Museum the Russians have
theirs rotting in the back yards of their launch pads, it's sad.
They Russian space agency would really appreciate the money
provided by private enterprise, they really
deserve a shot to help make this happen.
I would like to see other space agencies
like NASA get involved too.
\paragraph
\noindent
Bill I know you are interested in beating Linux at
it's own game, here is what you do... support Cygwin.
You can already run nearly all the Linux apps on Windows.
Steve Jobs has got Linux engineers flying to MacOS X
in droves because there are about 50 GUI's on Linux
hardly any of them any good except KDE. Windows is safe
your users don't want the headache of learning Linux.
KDE boys your software is far too expensive on Windows.
why don't you make your software MYPL
``pay us what you think the software is worth'',
In an ideal world everything should be under MYPL even food.
If KDE is any good people will pay you for it rather
than see it die. I personally hope that all the open
source GUI developers will stop reinventing the wheel
\& go with KDE \& give a consistent interface to Linux.
Bill I think all software should be sold under MYPL
All my software is officially under GPL but
unofficially I hope to be paid for it. I am a communist
rather than a capitalist unlike yourself who likes
haggling, I couldn't be arsed running around looking
for money off people who really don't want to give it to me,
possibly because they don't think my software is much good anyway
\& chasing ``software pirates'', it wastes too much energy.\\\\
Sincerely,
D.J. Barrow
