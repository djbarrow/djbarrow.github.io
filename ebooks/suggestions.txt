Hi Carsten I am not going to relax much at the moment,
I am quite often right.
As Madonna says life goes by so slowly lets
try to speed things up my turbo charger is
still running at full tilt.


Here are my suggestions for IBM & S3

James Blair see if you can get some of
the S3 guys over to IBM SchoenaicherStr 220
in boeblingen Pat Hurley needs to meet
the best freewheeling project manager I know
Erik Fichter.
Pat is playing with a safety net too much
he needs to know how fast a project can
be run if everyone plays to their strengths



Everybody should be giving tutorials
on what they know best & everyone
should be free to walk in & out
of each class till they find something
that intrests them


Sarah Flannery should give lectures in Mathematica & Number Theory
she is already doing this though would the guys in
Boeblingen be intrested in getting more lectures from her.
Karl Heinz Strassemeyer should go on some hormone
replacement therapy it bullshits to the body about
it's age also should try karate to
improve his knees some exercise & massageing them
would do them good he should teach aerodynamics
Feynman's lectures in physics book II would be
good lecture notes.
Dave Flannery in Maths should be teaching everything
his daughter is not teaching.
Segher Quantum Physics & Heavy Duty Mathematics.
Uli Weigand & Martin Schwidefsky & Hartmut
Penner Compiler theory & hacking.
Ken Fitzgeralds friend from Wales Hacking
electronics like a lunatic.
Aron Zeh Feynman, his Maxwell Equations Genius,
Maxwells equations
Jon Ronan Sys admin.
Mac Kristians & Jon's friend electronics
hacking & maxwells equations & feynman.
Kristian & Mike Butler localisation java eclipse & typesetting.

Charles Cheevers, James Blair,
Jim Lawton & Damien Fouilleul 
Dave & Sarah Flannery
are you intrested in going to Boeblingen with me next
week

Richard Feynman thinks Segher \& Cornelia Huck
would make a good item, I won't tell you how
I know this you would never believe me.
