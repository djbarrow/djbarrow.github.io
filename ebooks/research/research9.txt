I am 37 & have been around the block as a computer nerd.
I have been computer programming since I was 14
learned machine code at the age of 15 &
was writing interrupt driven music drivers.
I studied electronic engineering in college for 4 years.
In 1991 I got my first job as a games programmer
from programming knowledge I had before I went to college.
I worked in Apple computers & experienced the political
soap opera that is apple.
I worked on Linux for S/390 & helped breathe life into
a computer dinosaur & helped make it a roaring success.
I have read all of Feynmans lectures in physics &
have a keen intrest in quantum physics & electronics.
I may have a mild case of Aspergers syndrome a common
ailment with nerds who have difficulty establishing
relationships with women.
I lived life to excess & wasted a fortune on strippers
& had a mental breakdown which is quite common
among nerds but seldom talked about & have spent
2 occaisons totaling 6 months in psychiatric hospitals.
A large proportion of people who suffer from hypomanic
episodes have a religious experience consistent with
the religion they were brought up in.
I had a religious experience which involved me meeting
my gaurdian angels & them carrying me to my first
psychiatric hospital.
Suffering from Manic depression for 6 months I
thought I was the third smartest man in the World
& have written a computer program called fundamental
which might get me a Nobel Prize if the right
physicist might make use of it.
