      <P><FONT color=#cc0033 size=7>L</FONT>ike a scene from a science-fiction 
      movie, some of the sickest at University Medical Center are breathing 
      fluid as a critical life-saving treatment.<BR>Steven B. Johnson, MD, 
      associate professor of surgery at the University of Arizona College of 
      Medicine, and Steven R. Knoper, assistant research professor with the 
      College of Medicine, are leading a study examining liquid ventilation, a 
      new treatment that has produced impressive results. 
      <P>The liquid is administered to patients suffering from severe acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and breathing with the aid of 
      mechanical ventilation. The liquid ventilation therapy involves trickling 
      the fluid, LiquiVent<SUP>®</SUP>, into the patient's lungs through the 
      endotracheal tube. 
      <P>The fluid _ a clear, colorless, oily liquid that looks and flows like 
      water but is twice as dense _ carries oxygen and promotes respiratory gas 
      exchange while opening up the lungs. The dense fluid also serves to wash 
      out the ailing lungs, assisting in the removal of debris and other 
      contaminants.</FONT> </P></TD>

      <H5><I><FONT color=#ff0000>The ability of liquid perfluorochemicals (PFCs) 
      to support "liquid breathing" first was demonstrated in the early 1960s by 
      immersing a mouse in a glass beaker filled with an oxygenated PFC. 
      Although it was completely submerged in the liquid, the mouse was able to 
      breathe, which proved that the PFC was able to facilitate the exchange of 
      oxygen and carbon dioxide.</FONT></I> </H5>
      <P><FONT color=#ffffff>
      <P>The fluid is "radiopaque," allowing it to show up on X-rays for easy 
      identification in the lungs. 
      <P>Patients who have received the new therapy include individuals with 
      severe respiratory infection, such as advanced pneumonia and 
      trauma-related lung injuries, Dr. Johnson says. 
      <P>Since January, several UMC patients have been treated with the liquid 
      ventilation therapy. The patients who received the treatment were already 
      in the intensive care unit and required at least 2½ times the standard 
      amount of oxygen for a normally breathing person. 
      <P>"Individuals who have been treated with this therapy so far have done 
      very well," Dr. Johnson says. "They have all been on a respirator, and 
      have enjoyed significant improvement, leading to their eventual 
      extubation." 
      <P>UMC is testing the liquid ventilation therapy as part of a multi-center 
      international study on the treatment, and has ranked as the third-leading 
      international site for patient involvement in the study. Alliance 
      Pharmaceutical Corp. of San Diego is developing LiquiVent, the brand name 
      for the chemical perflubron. 
      <P>The UA Department of Surgery is working on the study in conjunction 
      with the critical care pulmonary section of the Arizona Respiratory 
      Sciences Center. Cheryl Gomez, RN, with the Department of Surgery's 
      Clinical Research Center, is coordinating the study.</I><IMG height=8
