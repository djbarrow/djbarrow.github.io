            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mars, (The Bringer of War) is known as the 
            'Red Planet', because of its distinctive red appearance from Space. 
            It has also featured in many theories involving alien civilizations 
            - there have been stories about it being the home of a hostile 
            civilization, the base of an advanced species of human and even the 
            home of a dying civilization! Many astromoners, such as Percival 
            Lowall, claimed that its 'canal-like' markings indicated that an 
            advanced alien species lived there. In 1964 however, the Mariner 4 
            probe - to the disappointment of many people - confirmed that at 
            present, there are no signs of an advanced civilizations but that 
            there are dried up riverbeds which means that there was once water 
            on Mars which in turn means it was actually capable of supporting 
            life once.</P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, Mars is depicted as being very similar 
            to Earth's moon - a small dust-covered lifeless body, cold, dry and 
            inhospitable. However, as our knowledge of this planet has increased 
            (very rapidly) over the past few decades, as Mars has become the 
            most visited and most known about planet, this notion has long since 
            been shattered, and has been replaced with one of a complex, 
            intriguing planet, with many exciting secrets yet to be revealed. 
            The simple, desert-like images beamed back by various landers on 
            Mars are merely a false façarde, for an interesting world, which 
            certainly has aroused a lot of interest in the past few years in 
            particular. There's a lot more to Mars than dust.</P>
            <P class=Big>Dust Covered Planet</P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways in which Mars has been able to 
            deceive people into believing it to be a fairly dull, uninsteresting 
            world is by being covered by dust. This is the most initially 
            striking feature about Mars. In fact, this very fine-grained 
            material, settled out of the atmosphere, is present throughout Mars, 
            and forms a thick layer even on the highest volcanoes. The dustier 
            areas of Mars are those which appear most bright.</P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this dust settles on Mars, it can trap 
            volatile materials, forming a mantle of icy dust. After some time, 
            these volatile ices can turn to dust, leaving strange pits. This icy 
            mantle, whose thickness varies throughout Mars (it is thickest at 
            the poles) is increasingly becoming the subject of scientific 
            investigations. Evidence suggests that this mantle may once even 
            have flowed like a fluid, thus bearing some resemblances to a 
            glacier here on Earth. 
            <P class=Big><A name=climate>Windy Weather, Climate and 
            Atmosphere</A></P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it may at first appear rather strange 
            for a cloudless planet, wind is actually a major characteristic of 
            Mars, and it is this wind which has shaped the Martian landscape 
            into what we see today. Spacecraft visiting the planet have 
            witnessed dust storms and avalanches, both seemingly caused by wind. 
            In fact, dust patterns behind some large objects can be observed to 
            change according over time, due to the varying wind conditions, and 
            sand dunes can be observed to move, due to dust deposition. Evidence 
            of erosion too can be found in craters.</P>
            <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Mars is smaller than the 
            Earth, its much slower spin means that a Martian day lasts only 41 
            minutes longer. In addition, Mars has a similar axial tilt as we do, 
            so a Martian year is made up of four distinct seasons. The years 
            themselves however are 687 days long, so each season would last 6 of 
            our months. Even though Mars' atmospheric pressure is less than 1% 
            that of the Earth's, it has a considerable impact on Mars, and it 
            can vary seasonally by up to 25%. Despite being thin, the presence 
            of dust and ice particles in the atmosphere give it some complex 
            dynamics, which go some way towards explaining why Martian weather 
            does contain such strong winds, in addition to variable low level 
            fogs, seasonal frost, high-level ice clouds and even dust 
storms.</P>
            <P class=Big><A name=water>Is There Water on Mars?</A></P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A distinct physical feature of Mars is the 
            presence of the two polar ice caps. Scientists have deduced that 
            these are composed mainly of water ice. Recent discoveries have 
            included discovering water ice below the Martian surface, present 
            for most if not all of the Martian year. In fact, Mars Odyssey 
            detected the presence of ground ice over most of the planet, apart 
            form the equatorial regions. However, despite this, significant 
            amounts of water in liquid form are not present on Mars, and have 
            not been for a very long time.</P>
            <P class=Big>The Changing Face of Mars</P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent evidence however has showed that the 
            Southern ice cap is being eroded at a relatively high rate, 
            prompting many theories about why this may be. It is thought that 
            the Martian climate and weather is actually changing over time.</P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that Mars 
            has changed significantly over time. For instance there's the fact 
            that the Southern hemisphere is high and heavily cratered, whereas 
            the Northern hemisphere is both lower and flatter, a sign that it is 
            younger. In addition, certain features along the edge of the 
            Southern highlands bear characteristics which could only have been 
            formed by liquid water. So whilst today Mars may look more similar 
            to the Moon than the Earth, there is evidence to suggest that this 
            may not have always been the case. 
            <P class=Big><A name=volcano>Volcanoes and Valleys</A></P>
            <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mars also has the largest volcanic 
            mountain in the Solar system - Olympus Mons, which is 27 kilometres 
            high and 600 km across! Not only that but it has a collection of 
            Volcanoes in the north that are so big that they deformed the 
            planet's spherity. It also has large spaces going down - the Vallis 
            Marineris canyon system stretches for over 5,000 kilometres and is 
            up to 7km deep - it's the dark patch you can can see to the right on 
            the picture above.</P>

            <P>Mars has two natural satellites - <A 
            href="http://www.solarspace.co.uk/Mars/phobosdeimos.php">Phobos</A> 
            (meaning fear) which orbits at just 5982km and <A 
            href="http://www.solarspace.co.uk/Mars/phobosdeimos.php">Deimos</A> 
            (meaning terror) which orbits at 23,000km and looks like a bright 
            star from the Martian sky. Because of their size and irregular 
            shapes, scientists believe they are captured asteroids. To find out

            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mars has been looked up to for centuries and 
            as I mentioned earlier, there have been many theories about it. It's 
            only recently however that we've been getting better, more close-up 
            pictures. The first close-up surface pictures were made in 1964/5 by 
            the Mariner 4. More high-resolution pictures followed form Mariners 
            6 and 7 but it wasn't until 1971 and Mariner 9 that detailed photos 
            of Phobos and Deimos were taken. In the same year the Soviet Mars 2 
            dropped the first capsule on Mars. Then in 1975 the Viking landers 
            arrived at the moon taking photographs from the surface. Then there 
            was a big gap until December 1996, when the NASA Mars pathfinder 
            landed on Mars. This was basically a robot which was controlled from 
            Earth and which explored Mars and conducted experiments, making many 
            new discoveries. The Pathfinder was followed by the NASA Mars Polar 
            lander in 1999 and I think it's fair to say that it was a big flop. 
            It was meant to be a mission to search for water on Mars but in the 
            end radio signals were lost with the MPL. There are more missions 
            planned for the future though, including the very promising and 
            exciting 'Mars Express' from <A
