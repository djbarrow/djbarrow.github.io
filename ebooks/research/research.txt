Ramjet in space
The problems of how to scoop up the tenuous 
interstellar medium with a density of about 1 atom/cm3 
were very difficult to resolve.

Electronics problem
Finally Mr. Tony Lawton returned everyone to Earth by
pointing out the limitations of semiconductor devices
in a cosmic radiation environment. 
Even the radiation received by the electronic devices
from the motion of the vehicle at 15% of the speed of
light relative to the interstellar medium would prevent
operation of today's components after considerably less
than thirty years exposure.
