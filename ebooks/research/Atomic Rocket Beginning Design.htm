<H2>RADIATION SHIELDING</H2>
<P><A name=radshield>Don't</A> forget the solid lead and paraffin anti-radiation 
"shadow shield" between the atomic engine and <STRONG><EM>Polaris'</EM></STRONG> 
crew <EM>(lead for gamma shielding, paraffin for neutron shielding)</EM>. As a 
matter of fact, you probably want to design the ship so that 
<STRONG><EM>everything</EM></STRONG> is between the engine and the crew.</P>
<P>Note that the larger the distance between the crew and the atomic engine, the 
narrow the angle the shadow has to be, thus the smaller the shadow shield. Since 
the shadow shield is several tons of rocket mass that is not payload, the 
smaller it is, the better. Also note that radiation weakens with distance due to 
the inverse-square law, which is another argument in favor of plenty of 
distance. As <A 
href="http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3d.html#multiple">previously 
mentioned</A>, if the rocket has multiple atomic engines one wants them 
clustered closely or they will require a larger shadow shield, or even one 
shield for each engine. <EM>(for "cluster closely" read: "have the radioactive 
components as close to the axis of the spacecraft as possible")</EM> </P>

      <P>In Heinlein's <EM>"The Green Hills of Earth"</EM>, atomic spacecraft 
      designers are guilty of scrimping on shadow shields in order to save mass. 
      The designers were under pressure to maximize payload mass without 
      worrying about trivial incidentals like the health of the engine crew. 
      This is why the jetmen working next to the atomic engines find it so hard 
      to get insurance, and seldom have children. At least ones that are not

<P>From <STRONG>"The Green Hills of Earth</STRONG> by Robert Heinlein. 1947. 
</P><EM style="COLOR: #bbffff">
<P>Ten minutes later he was back. "Captain," he stated darkly, "that number two 
jet ain't fit. The cadmium dampers are warped." </P>
<P>"Why tell me? Tell the Chief." </P>
<P>"I did, but he says they will do. He's wrong." </P>
<P>The captain gestured at the book. "Scratch out your name and scram. We raise 
ship in thirty minutes." </P>
<P>Rhysling looked at him, shrugged, and went below again. </P>
<P>It is a long climb to the Jovian planetoids; a Hawk-class clunker had to 
blast for three watches before going into free flight. Rhysling had the second 
watch. Damping was done by hand then, with a multiplying vernier and a danger 
gauge. When the gauge showed red, he tried to correct it -- no luck. </P>
<P>Jetmen don't wait; that's why they are jetmen. He slapped the emergency 
discover and fished at the hot stuff with the tongs. The lights went out, he 
went right ahead. A jetman has to know his power room the way your tongue knows 
the inside of your mouth. </P>
<P>He sneaked a quick look over the top of the lead baffle when the lights went 
out. The blue radioactive glow did not help him any; he jerked his head back and 
went on fishing by touch. </P>
<P>When he was done he called over the tube, "Number two jet out. And for 
crissake get me some light down here!" </P>
<P>There was light -- the emergency circuit -- but not for him. The blue 
radioactive glow was the last thing his optic nerve ever responded to. </P>
<P>* * *</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rhysling obliged, then said, "You youngsters have got it soft. Everything 
automatic. When I was twisting her tail you had to stay awake." </P>
<P>"You still have to stay awake." They fell to talking shop and Macdougal 
showed him the direct response damping rig which had replaced the manual vernier 
control which Rhysling had used. Rhysling felt out the controls and asked 
questions until he was familiar with the new installation. It was his conceit 
that he was still a jetman and that his present occupation as a troubadour was 
simply an expedient during one of the fusses with the company that any man could 
get into. </P>
<P>"I see you still have the old hand damping plates installed," he remarked, 
his agile fingers flitting over the equipment. </P>
<P>"All except the links. I unshipped them because they obscure the dials." </P>
<P>"You ought to have them shipped. You might need them." </P>
<P>"Oh, I don't know. I think--" Rhysling never did find out what Macdougal 
thought for it was at that moment the trouble tore loose. Macdougal caught it 
square, a blast of radioactivity that burned him down where he stood. </P>
<P>Rhysling sensed what had happened. Automatic reflexes of old habit came out. 
He slapped the discover and rang the alarm to the control room simultaneously. 
Then he remembered the unshipped links. He had to grope until he found them, 
while trying to keep as low as he could to get maximum benefit from the baffles. 
Nothing but the links bothered him as to location. The place was as light to him 
as any place could be; he knew every spot, every control, the way he knew the 
keys of his accordion. </P>
<P>"Power room! Power room! What's the alarm?" </P>
<P>"Stay out!" Rhysling shouted. "The place is 'hot.'" He could feel it on his 
face and in his bones, like desert sunshine. </P>
<P>The links he got into place, after cursing someone, anyone, for having failed 
to rack the wrench he needed. Then he commenced trying to reduce the trouble by 
hand. It was a long job and ticklish. Presently he decided that the jet would 
have to be spilled, pile and all. </P>
<P>First he reported. "Control!" </P>
<P>"Control aye aye!" </P>
<P>"Spilling jet three -- emergency." </P>
<P>"Is this Macdougal?" </P>
<P>"Macdougal is dead. This is Rhysling, on watch. Stand by to record." </P>
<P></P>The ship was safe now and ready to limp home shy one jet. As for himself, 
Rhysling was not so sure. That "sunburn" seemed sharp, he thought. He was unable 
to see the bright, rosy fog in which he worked but he knew it was there. He went 
on with the business of flushing the air out through the outer valve, repeating 
it several times to permit the level of radioaction to drop to something a man 
might stand under suitable armor.

<P>Keep in mind that these are called "shadow" shields because it is too 
expensive to put radiation shielding all around the hot stuff <EM>("expensive" 
in terms of reduction of payload mass)</EM>. This means that if one ventures 
outside of the spacecraft, you run the danger of moving out of the shadow and 
into the deadly glow of the unshielded engine. When the spacecraft is designed, 
it is also important to ensure that no part of the ship scatters the lethal 
radiation around the shadow shield and into the crew. The heat radiators, for 
instance. If lifting off from a planet with an atmosphere, said atmosphere can 
also create pesky neutron backscatter.</P>

      <P>This does make exiting a landed ship somewhat challenging, and makes an 
      argument for a ground crew wearing lead suits. In the Tom Corbett books, 
      any ship that was to be on the ground for more than three days would have 
      its liquid fissionable fuel removed by the "hot soup" wagon. Keep in mind 
      that the neutron flux from the engine would transmute the elements 
      composing the rocket's structure, making the aft end of the spacecraft 
      radioactive even if all the fissionables are removed. Spaceship designers 
      should also construct the aft end of the spacecraft out of materials that 
      are not only strong, but that will transmute into materials of still 
      acceptable strength.</P></TD>

<P>When we stepped out of the little car it went back where it came from. In

HAZARD-Optimax 13 Seconds. The figures had been chalked in. I stopped. I have no 
special interest in offspring but I am no fool. Dak grinned and said, "Got your 
lead britches on? Open it, go through at once and straight up the ladder into 
the ship. If you don't stop to scratch, you'll make it with at least three 
seconds to spare." </P>

<P>An interesting solution was in the old "B" movie Battle in Outer Space. 
Consider, if a girder is thirty meters long when it is vertical, it is still 
thirty meters long if horizontal. Say that thirty meters is a safe distance from 
the atomic drive in the ship's tail. Attach a thirty meter girder by a hinge on 
the atomic drive, and put an elevator cage on the other end. When the girder is 
vertical, the landing party enters the cage, a safe thirty meters from the 
drive. The girder then pivots on the hinge until the cage is on the ground. All 
this time the landing party is still at a safe distance. They then exit the cage 
onto the planet's surface. If the ship is streamlined, the girder and cage will 
be recessed into the hull, with the outer part of the girder covered by the 
ship's skin <EM>(you can see the recess hole in the middle picture above)</EM>.

<P>"Does that give anyone a notion of why the Mayflower was assembled out in an 
orbit and will never ever land anywhere?" </P>
<P>"Too hot," somebody said. </P>
<P>"'Too hot' is an understatement. If the Mayftower had blasted off from Mojave 
space port the whole Los Angeles Borough of the City of Southern California 
would have been reduced to a puddle of lava and people would have been killed by 
radiation and heat from Bay City to Baja California. And that will give you an 
idea of why the shielding runs right through the ship between here and the power 
plant, with no way at all to get at the torch." </P>
<P>We had the misfortune to have Noisy Edwards along, simply because he was from 
the same bunk room. Now he spoke up and said, "Suppose you have to make a 
repair?" </P>
<P>"There is nothing to go wrong," explained Mr. Ortega. "The power plant has no 
moving parts of any sort" </P>
<P>Noisy wasn't satisfied. "But suppose something did go wrong, how would you 
fix it if you can't get at it?" </P>
<P>Noisy has an irritating manner at best; Mr. Ortega sounded a little impatient 
when he answered. "Believe me, son, even if you could get at it, you wouldn't 
want to. No indeed!" </P>
<P>"Humph!" said Noisy. "All I've got to say is, if there isn't any way to make 
a repair when a repair is needed, what's the use in sending engineer officers 
along?" </P>
<P>You could have heard a pin drop. Mr. Ortega turned red, but all he said was, 
"Why, to answer foolish questions from youngsters like yourself, I suppose." He 
turned to the rest of us. "Any more questions?" </P>
<P>Naturally nobody wanted to ask any then. He added, "I think that's enough for 
one session. School's out." </P>
<P>I told Dad about it later. He looked grim and said, "I'm afraid Chief 
Engineer Ortega didn't tell you the whole truth." </P>
<P>"Huh?" </P>
<P>"In the first place there is plenty for him to do in taking care of the 
auxiliary machinery on this side of the shield. But it is possible to get at the 
torch, if necessary." </P>
<P>"Huh? How?" </P>
<P>"There are certain adjustments which could conceivably have to be made in 
extreme emergency. In which case it would be Mr. Ortega's proud privilege to 
climb into a space suit, go outside and back aft, and make them." </P>
<P>"You mean--" </P>
<P>"I mean that the assistant chief engineer would succeed to the position of 
chief a few minutes later. Chief engineers are very carefully chosen, Bill, and 
not just for their technical knowledge." </P>
<P>It made me feel chilly inside; I didn't like to think about it. </P></EM>

<P>There was some 1950's era spacecraft designs that attempted to substitute 
distance for lead shielding <EM>(since distance weighs nothing)</EM>. They were 
practical designs for exploration craft but pretty silly for warships. Crew 
cabins on the end of hundred meter booms, or dangling at the end of kilometer 
long cables, that sort of thing. While you wouldn't want to use the designs, you 
understand the motivation. When every gram is limited, you don't want to waste 
it on a shield made out of one of the heaviest elements in existence. The 
break-even point is where the mass of the boom or cable is equal to the mass of 
the shadow shield. One source suggested that occured at a cable length of one 
kilometer.</P>

      <P>As an interesting side note, rockets constructed of aluminum are 
      extremely vulnerable to splashes of metallic mercury or dustings of 
      mercury salts. On aluminum, mercury is an <A 
      href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/mar98/889541118.Ch.r.html">"oxidizing 
      catalyst"</A>, which means the blasted stuff can <A 
      href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/science/3c2c0b4511b84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html">corrode 
      through an aluminum beam</A> in a matter of hours <EM>(in an atmosphere 
      containing oxygen, of course)</EM>. This is why mercury thermometers are 
      forbidden on commercial aircraft. </P>
      <P>Why? Ordinarily aluminum would corrode much faster than iron. However, 
      iron oxide, <EM>i.e.,</EM> "rust", flakes off, exposing more iron to be 
      attacked. But aluminum oxide, <EM>i.e.,</EM> "sapphire", sticks tight, 
      protecting the remaining aluminum with a gem-hard barrier. Except mercury 
      washes the protective layer away, allowing the aluminum to be consumed by 
      galloping rust. </P>
      <P>Alkalis will have a similar effect on aluminum, and acids have a 
      similar effect on magnesium <EM>(you can dissolve magnesium with 
      vinegar)</EM>. As far as I know nothing really touches titanium, its 
      corrosion-resistance is second only to platinum. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>When laying out the floor plan, you want the spacecraft to balance. That is, 
if you draw a line from the center of the exhaust bell through the spacecraft's 
center of gravity, if you continue the line it had better pass through the 
spacecraft's nose. Otherwise your ship is going to loop-the-loop or tumble like 
a cheap Fourth of July skyrocket <EM>(Heinlein calls this a rocket "falling off 
its tail")</EM>. This means that each deck should be "radially symmetric". 
That's a fancy way of saying that if you have something massive in the 
north-west corner of "D" deck, you'd better have something equally massive in 
the south-east corner. This is another reason to strap down the crew during a 
burn. Walking around could upset the ship's balance, resulting in the dreaded 
rocket tumble. This will be more of a problem with tiny ships than with huge 
cruisers, of course. Small ships might have "trim tanks", small tanks into which 
water can be pumped in order to adjust the balance. The ship will also have 
heavy gyroscopes that will help prevent the ship from falling off its tail, but 
there is a limit to how much imbalance that they can compensate for. </P>
<P>Most of the propellant of a GC engine will be hydrogen <EM>(the fissionable 
fuel will probably be less than 1% of the total propellant load)</EM> since you 
want propellant with the lowest molecular mass. Liquid hydrogen has a density of 
0.07 grams per cubic centimeter. 792.6 tons of propellant = 792,600,000 grams / 
0.07 = 11,323,000,000 cubic centimeters = 11,323 cubic meters . The volume of a 
sphere is <STRONG>4/3&#960;r<SUP>3</SUP></STRONG> so you can fit 11,323 cubic meters 
in a sphere about 14 meters in radius . Almost 92 feet in diameter, egad! It is 
a pity hydrogen isn't a bit denser. If this offends your aesthetic sense, you'll 
have to go back and change a few parameters. Maybe a 2<SUP>nd</SUP> generation 
GC rocket, and a mission from <A 
href="http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3Notes.html#terra">Terra</A> to 
Mars but not back. Maybe use methane instead of hydrogen. It only has an exhaust 
velocity of 6318 m/s instead of hydrogen's superior 8800 m/s, but it has a 
density of 0.42 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>, which would only require a 1.7 meter radius 
tank. <EM>(Methane has a higher exhaust velocity than one would expect from its 
molecular weight, due to the fact that the GC engine is hot enough to turn 
methane into carbon and hydrogen. Note that in a NERVA style engine the reactor 
might become clogged with carbon deposits.)</EM></P>
<P><A name=tankmass>Robert</A> Zubrin says that as a rule of thumb, the mass of 
a fuel tank loaded with liquid hydrogen will be about 87% hydrogen and 13% tank. 
In other words, multiply the mass of the liquid hydrogen by 
<STRONG>0.15</STRONG> to get the mass of the empty tank <EM>(0.13 / 0.87 = 
0.15)</EM>. So our 792.6 tons of hydrogen will need a tank that masses 792.6 * 
0.15 = <STRONG>119 tons.</STRONG> </P>
<P>87% propellant and 13% tank is for a rocket designed to land on a planet. An 
orbit-to-orbit rocket could get by with more hydrogen and less tank. This is 
because the tanks can be more flimsy since they will not have to endure the 
stress of landing <EM>(A landing-capable rocket that uses a propellant denser 
than hydrogen can also get away with a smaller tank percentage)</EM>. Zubrin 
gives the following ballpark estimates of the tank percentage: </P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>Argon <EM>(ion rocket)</EM> - 4% 
  <LI>Water <EM>(Nuclear salt water rocket)</EM> - 4% 
  <LI>Hydrogen <EM>(NTR / GCR)</EM> - 10% 
  <LI>LOX/Hydrogen - 6% </LI></UL>
<P>If you are going to use aerobraking to land your rocket, Zubrin says mass of 
the heat shield and thermal structure will be about 15% of the total mass being 
braked. As a wild guess, aerobraking will be limited to killing a velocity of no 
more than 15 to 30 kilometers per second. This will mostly be used for our 
purposes designing a emergency re-entry life pod, not a Solar Guard patrol ship. 
With a sufficiently advanced engine it is more effective just to carry more 
fuel, so our atomic cruiser will not need to waste mass on such a primitive 
device. </P>
<P>In the movie 2010, the good ship <EM>Leonov</EM> had a one-lung propulsion 
system, so they needed an aerobraking "ballute" to slow them into Jovan orbit. 
If you are thinking about aerobraking, keep in mind that many worlds in the 
Solar System do not have atmospheres. </P>

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator">Radioisotope 
thermoelectric generators</A> <EM>(RTG)</EM> are slugs of radioisotopes 
<EM>(usually plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium oxide)</EM> that heat up due 
to nuclear decay, and surrounded by thermocouples to turn the heat into 
electricity. There are engineering reasons that make it impractical to design an 
RTG that produces more than one kilowatt. Plutonium-238 has a half life of 85 
years, <EM>i.e.,</EM> the power output will drop to one half after 85 years. To 
calculate power decay: </P>
<P><STRONG>P<SUB>1</SUB> = P<SUB>0</SUB> * 
0.9919^Y</STRONG></P>where:<BR>P<SUB>1</SUB> = current power output 
<EM>(watts)</EM><BR>P<SUB>0</SUB> = power output when RTG was constructed 
<EM>(watts)</EM><BR>Y = years since RTG was constructed. 
<P>Example: If a new RTG outputs 470 watts, in 23 years it will output 470 x 
0.9919^23 = 470 x 0.83 = <STRONG>390 watts</STRONG></P>
<P>Wolfgang Weisselberg points out that this equation just measures the drop in 
the power output of the slug of plutonium. In the real world, the thermocouples 
will deteriorate under the constant radioactive bombardment, which will reduce 
the actual electrical power output even further. Looking at the RTGs on NASA's 
Voyager space probe, it appears that the thermocouples deteriorate at roughly 
the same rate as the plutonium.</P>
<P>Plutonium-238 has a specific power of 0.56 watts/gm or 560 watts per 
kilogram, so in theory all you would need is 470 / 560 = 0.84 kilograms. Alas, 
the thermoelectric generator which converts the thermal energy to electric 
energy has an efficiency of only a few percent. If the thermoelectric efficiency 
is 5%, the plutonium RTG has an effective specific power of 560 x 0.05 = 28 
watts per kilogram <EM>(0.036 kilogram per watt or 36 kg/kW)</EM>. This means 
you will need an entire 17 kilos of plutonium to produce 470 watts. </P>
<P>Solar power arrays are about 45 kg/kW, and of course their power level goes 
down the farther from the Sun they travel.</P>
<P>Nuclear fission reactors are about 18 kg/kW. However, Los Alamos labs had an 
amazing one megawatt Heat Pipe reactor that was only 493 kg: </P>

Since the reactor is running warm at a low level all the time <EM>(instead of

      <H2>HEAT RADIATORS</H2>
      <P>Power plants and some propulsion systems are going to require <A 
      href="http://website.lineone.net/~geowood/radiator.htm">heat radiators</A> 
      to avoid system meltdown. There are only three ways of getting rid of 
      heat: convection, conduction, and radiation; and the first two do not work 
      at all in the vacuum of space. So the ship designer is stuck with heat 
      radiators. See <A 
      href="http://www.adastragames.com/products/adastra/hightrader.html">HIGH 
      TRADER</A> for details. <A href="http://www.adastragames.com/">Ken 
      Burnside</A> also noted that radiators are large, flimsy, and impossible 
      to armor <EM>(except perhaps for the droplet radiator)</EM>. A liability 
      on a warship. If you want to calculate this for yourself:</P>

<TABLE>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>
      <P>Ken Burnside says that if one examine the equation carefully one will 
      notice that the radiator effectiveness goes up at the fourth power of the 
      heat of the radiator. The higher the temperature, the lower the surface 
      area can be, which lowers the required mass of radiator fins. This is why 
      most radiator designs use liquid sodium or lithium <EM>(or things more 
      exotic, still)</EM>. 1600K radiators mean that you need a lot less mass 
      than 273 K radiators. </P>
      <P>Propulsion systems like nuclear thermal rockets do not need heat 
      radiators because the waste heat is carried away by the exhaust plume. In 
      effect, the exhaust <EM>is</EM> their radiator <EM>(the technical term is 
      <STRONG>"Open-Cycle Cooling"</STRONG>)</EM>. Electrical powered drives 
      like ion drives will require radiators on their power plants. Fusion 
      drives may or may not require radiators, depending upon whether the design 
      can dump the waste heat into the exhaust or not. </P>
      <P>My source <EM>(Matthew DeBell)</EM> says that if &#8706;Q/&#8706;t = 150 gigawatts 
      and R<SUB>t</SUB> = 3000° K, R<SUB>a</SUB> would be 
      <STRONG>34,941m<SUP>2</SUP></STRONG>. Actually it could be half that if 
      you have a two-sided radiator, which would make the radiator a square 
      90-odd meters on a side. I have no idea how to estimate how much mass a 
      radiator of a given size will be. At a rough guess, you are looking at 
      0.01 to 0.05 kilograms per kilowatt dissipated. <EM>(The table I was 
      looking at said that a flimsy radiator operating at 1100° K would be 0.01 
      kg/kW and an armored meteor proof radiator operating at 2000° K would be 
      0.05 kg/kW)</EM></P></TD>

<EM style="COLOR: #bbffff">
<P>Liquid-droplet radiators are also a possibility. There do exist liquids which 
have extremely low vapor pressure at high temperatures - certain organics up to 
~600K, liquid metals (esp. lithium) to ~1500K. Using a carefully-designed nozzle 
to create a fan-shaped spray of fine droplets towards a linear collector results 
in a very efficient radiator, with minimal weight per unit radiating surface, 
high temperature, and high throughput. </P>
<P>The radiator would be essentially triangular when "deployed", with the spray 
nozzle at one vertex and the collector along the opposite side. If the 
nozzle-vertes is adjacent to the ship body, the collector "arm" will have to 
extend outwards. Alternately, the collector can be run along the side of the 
ship, and the spray nozzle extended on a boom and aimed inwards. A series of 
closely-spaced, narrow-angle nozzles would approximate a rectangular array. </P>
<P>There is always <STRONG>some</STRONG> loss of coolant due to evaporation in 
vacuum, hence use of liquids with extremely low vapor pressure. You also lose 
coolant if such a radiator is run under acceleration, unless the collector is 
over-long and aligned parallel to the thrust axis, which imposes a constraint on 
system geometry. You also lose coolant if the radiator "panel" is hit by enemy 
weapons fire; on the other hand there is no mechanical damage unless the much 
smaller nozzle or collector arms are hit. Bottom line - you'll need a small 
surplus of coolant, unless you are running a warship, in which case you'll need 
a <STRONG>large</STRONG> surplus. </P>
<P>If liquid metal is used as the coolant, <A 
href="http://www-ferp.ucsd.edu/THERMAL/mhd.shtml">MHD pumping</A> can be used at 
the collector arms, resulting in a simplified design with no moving parts. 
Indeed, in such a case the coolant could also be used as the working fluid in an 
MHD generator, resulting in a single-fluid, single-cycle power system from 
primary energy generation to waste heat radiation. Again, a simple, efficient 
design with no moving parts. </P></EM>

<P>What color will the radiators glow? A practical one will only glow dull red. 
You can use the <A 
href="http://www.shodor.org/refdesk/Resources/Models/BlackbodyRadiation/index.php">Blackbody 
Spectrum Viewer</A> to see what temperature corresponds to what color. If it was 
glowing white hot, the temperature would be around 6000 Kelvin. This would be 
difficult for a solid radiator, since even diamond melts at 4300 degrees K. </P>
<P>Technically you also need radiators to keep the life-system habitable. Human 
bodies produce an amazing amount of heat. However, since it will be tasked with 
dissipating mere kilowatts while the drive radiators have to get rid of 
gigawatts, you can assume that the drive radiator can take care of the 
life-system as well. Or if the propulsion system needs no radiator, the 
life-system radiator is small enough to be placed over part of the hull. The 
life-system radiators on the <A 
href="http://nasaexplores.nasa.gov/show_912_student_st.php?id=040526125151">Space 
Shuttle</A> are inside the cargo bay doors, which is why the doors are always 
open while the shuttle is in space.</P>
<HR>

<P>Here is some scary math about radiators from Tony Valle, along with some 
interesting conclusion: </P><EM style="COLOR: #bbffff">
<P>It is surprising but there is an optimum temperature ratio at which to run a 
starship heat exchanger (or similar power source) to achieve maximum free power 
with a minimum of radiator area. The only assumptions necesary are that the 
power source obeys the laws of thermodynamics and that the starship may only get 
rid of waste heat by radiating. </P>
<P>Let us assume that we have a heat engine as a power source with a relative 
efficiency of &#951; (its absolute efficiency is &#951; times the Carnot efficiency &#949;). We 
can write the available free power, F, as: </P><STRONG>F = Q&#951;&#949; = Q&#951;(1 - 
T<SUB>1</SUB>/T<SUB>2</SUB>)</STRONG> 
<P>where Q is the rate of heat flow into the exchanger and T<SUB>1</SUB> and 
T<SUB>2</SUB> are the temperatures of the cold and hot sides of the engine, 
respectively. The waste heat, H, released into the starship is Q - F, or: 
</P><STRONG>H = Q(1 - &#951; + &#951;T<SUB>1</SUB>/T<SUB>2</SUB>)</STRONG><BR><STRONG>H = 
F (1 - &#951; + &#951;T<SUB>1</SUB>/T<SUB>2</SUB>)/&#951;(1 - 
T<SUB>1</SUB>/T<SUB>2</SUB>)</STRONG><BR>
<P>For simplicity, we will measure temperature in units of T<SUB>2</SUB> and let 
T<SUB>1</SUB> be called just T. The amount of waste heat associated with a given 
free power is then (after dividing through by &#951;): </P><STRONG>H = F 
(&#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> - 1 + T) / (1 -T)</STRONG><BR>
<P>Now this waste heat must be radiated away from the ship. The power radiated 
by a black body at temperature T and with area A is given by the 
Stephan-Boltzmann Law: </P><STRONG>P = &#963;AT<SUP>4</SUP></STRONG><BR>
<P>with &#963; a constant depending on the choice of units. Setting these equal to 
each other gives: </P><STRONG>A = F (&#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> - 1 + T) / &#963;(T<SUP>4</SUP> - 
T<SUP>5</SUP>) </STRONG><BR>
<P>Now we can ask what value of T will give the minimum radiator area. Taking 
the derivative of A with respect to T and setting it equal to zero gives: 
</P><STRONG>(T<SUP>4</SUP> - T<SUP>5</SUP>) - (4T<SUP>3</SUP> - 
5T<SUP>4</SUP>)(&#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> - 1 + T) = 0</STRONG><BR>
<P>Or, dividing by T<SUP>3</SUP> and expanding: </P><STRONG>T - T<SUP>2</SUP> - 
4&#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> + 4 - 4T + 5T&#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> - 5T + 5T<SUP>2</SUP> = 
0</STRONG><BR>
<P>After collecting terms, we have: </P><STRONG>4T<SUP>2</SUP> + 
(5&#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> - 8)T + 4(1 - &#951;<SUP>-1</SUP>) = 0</STRONG><BR>
<P>or, dividing through by 4:</P><STRONG>T<SUP>2</SUP> + (5/4&#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> - 
2)T + (1 - &#951;<SUP>-1</SUP>) = 0</STRONG><BR>
<P>We write &#951;<SUP>-1</SUP> as &#947; then the solution to the above quadratic can be 
written: </P><STRONG>T = 1 - 5/8&#947; + 1/8 sqrt(25&#947;<SUP>2</SUP> - 16&#947;)</STRONG><BR>
<P>In the special case where the exchanger runs at maximum theoretical 
efficiency, &#951; = &#947; = 1 and the equation above gives T = 3/4. This means that the 
cold side of the heat engine is at 75% of the temperature of the hot side. Of 
course, this is not very efficient as a heat engine goes, but if the total waste 
heat is dropped by lowering the temperature of the cold side, the total radiator 
area must be <STRONG>increased!</STRONG> This is because of the T<SUP>4</SUP> 
behavior of the radiation law - as the temperature of the radiator drops, it 
dumps heat much less efficiently. This function is fairly flat - the value of T 
only goes from 0.75 to 0.80 as the relative efficiency goes from 1 to 0.1.

<P>From <A

Gwinner</A></P><EM style="COLOR: #bbffff">
<P>Take a classic space opera warship. Onboard power is generated by one or more 
fusion reactors. If the overall power is 2 gigawatts, and the efficiency is 90% 
(a pretty generous estimate, since projections I've seen for MHD power 
generation are around 60%) then at full power, the reactors create 200MW of 
waste heat. At these sorts of power levels the waste heat of the crew, 
computers, coffee makers, etc. can be ignored. If there are energy weapons, 
assume they too are 90% efficient and use 500MW of power when fired, generating 
another 50MW waste heat. Lump in a lot of other minor systems and you get 
something like 300MW total waste heat that has to be gotten rid of at peak. </P>
<P>Where it gets complex, AFAIK, is the question of how hot you can allow the 
ship's interior to get. Let's assume that the environmental areas have heat 
pumps that allow them to stay a fair amount cooler than the engineering areas 
(since they're not generating the majority of the heat to begin with) and there 
are no low-temperature superconductors and so forth to worry about. If the 
engines and weapons can operate happily at 150 degrees Celsius, that's 423 
degrees Kelvin. So that's our starting point -- the coolant (probably liquid 
sodium or lithium at that temp) gets that hot before it's pumped through the 
radiators to cool off again, at which point: </P>
<P><STRONG>Heat lost [watts] = 5.67e-8[Stefan's Constant] * area [m^2] * 
emissivity * T^4 [degrees Kelvin]</STRONG>. </EM>
<P>(ed note: same equation as above)</P><EM style="COLOR: #bbffff">
<P></P>
<P>If the radiators are perfectly black (emissivity of 1), and the coolant 
temperature is 423 degrees K, then in order to radiate away 275MW of heat, the 
radiator needs be about 150,000 square meters in area (of course it's 
double-sided, so the actual fin(s) only need to be 75,000 m^ 2). That's a square 
275 meters on a side, or roughly a large city block, simply to deal with the 
ship's own waste heat at full power. If the ship needs to radiate away 
additional heat due to taking in, say, 400MW of energy from an enemy ship's 
lasers, you'd probably have to double or triple that figure (and make darn sure 
to keep your fins edge-on to the enemy ship firing at you! :). Of course all 
this is very crude and assumes perfect efficiency of a number of things (some of 
which I'm probably unaware of :). In reality you might get 80% of that 
theoretical performance. Or perhaps less. And the first thing damaged in a 
battle would probably be the radiators (big, hard to protect). </P>
<P>The structural mass of a large radiator fin could be a substantial fraction 
of the entire ship's mass, and that slows down the acceleration of the ship, 
which needs more power for thrust, which gives off more waste heat, and so on... 
So the idea of using spray wands and droplet coolants is attractive. </P>
<P>OTOH, if you need to keep the whole ship at a comfy temperature like 20C, 
then it's almost hopeless. The radiating area required is so enormous that high 
acceleration isn't practical at all (something like half a million m^2). </P>
<P>Another alternative is to design the ship to only radiate away normal, 
routine power levels, and to boil off propellant to deal with peak loads. But 
that goes through a lot of propellant pretty fast at high power levels. 
Dreadnaughts become like modern jet fighters -- only good for a few minutes of 
intense combat before the fuel runs out. Once it's gone, you can't crash, but 
you have to surrender or be boiled... </P></EM>
<P>(ed note: He is assuming that the radiator temperature is 423K. Some of the 
other estimates were for radiator temperatures of 1600K to 3000K, which would 
drastically lower the radiator surface area.) </P>

<P>Before you start designing the rest of the spacecraft, you should decide what 
sort of <A 
href="http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3t.html#shipgrid">functions</A> it 
will have to perform. Is it a cargo vessel? A tanker? A warship? The outer space 
version of a Coast Guard vessel? A blockade runner? This will give a rough idea 
of what most of the payload mass will be <EM>(cargo holds, remarkably large mass 
ratio, weapons, deep space rescue gear, stealth technology and oversized 
engines)</EM>. </P>
<P>Speaking of cargo, present-day cargo ships are rated in "Net tonnage" or 
"Gross register tonnage", where each "ton" actually indicates 100 cubic feet of 
volume. The average cargo they carry has a density of 350 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>. If 
the cargo has a wildly different density, some math will be needed, but for most 
cargo the net tonnage gives a good idea of the ship's cargo capacity. In 
practice, while filling the cargo hold it will either "mass-out" or "bulk-out", 
depending on which it runs out of first: lifting capacity or cargo space. </P>
<P>In international shipping, a standard cargo container is 25 metric tons in 
100 cubic meters. </P>

<P>As you are beginning to discover, mass is limited on a spacecraft. Many 
Heinlein novels have passengers given strict limits on their combined 
body+luggage mass. Officials would look disapprovingly at the passenger's 
waistlines and wonder out loud how they can stand to carry around all that 
"penalty weight". There are quite a few scenes in various Heinlein novels of the 
agony of packing for a rocket flight, throwing away stuff left and right in a 
desperate attempt to get the mass of your luggage below your mass allowance.</P>

      <P>Rocketeers would tend to be short and wiry. In Sir Arthur C. Clarke's 
      classic THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SKY, space station construction crews got a 
      pay bonus if they kept their weight below 150 pounds. Note that this would 
      also be a good argument for rocketeers being [a] Oriental, [b] Female, or 
      [c] Both.</P>
      <P>Other innovations are possible. Perhaps boxes of food where the boxes 
      are edible as well. The corridor floors will probably be metal gratings to 
      save mass <EM>(<A name=skirt>This</A> is the second reason why female 
      cadet shipboard uniforms will not have skirts. The first reason is the

      thumb-tip, with a tiny magnifying glass. Try to make every gram do double

<P>"If it's economically feasible," Yueh said. "Arrakis has many costly perils." 
He smoothed his drooping mustache. "Your father will be here soon. Before I go, 
I've a gift for you, something I came across in packing." He put an object on 
the table between them-black, oblong, no larger than the end of Paul's thumb.

<P>Paul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought: 
How cautious he is. </P>
<P>"It's a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a 
filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and 
electrostatic charge system." He picked it up, demonstrated. "The book is held 
closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the 
edge-thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book opens." 
</P>
<P>"It's so small." </P>
<P>"But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge-thus, and so . . . and 
the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the actual 
pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate." He closed the 
book, handed it t o Paul. "Try it." </P></EM>
