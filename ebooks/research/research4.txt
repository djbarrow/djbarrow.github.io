Let me tell you about Anne O' Sullivan the woman that drove me to no 
fear
& the level of creativity I have now.

She is Tom O Sullivans adopted daughter & at 13 looked at the most 
headfucked
25 year old in the Church in Glantane & said he needs me.
At 15 the test came a dropped tennis ball she was nearer & more in need 
of the exercise
& Slut Ruby picked it up instead.

She is getting married very soon 
I am going to have karate sex with her anyway.
I will look after her kids with the least self confidence because I 
know
they have her metal.

Tell her I love her to peices

Phone: 00353-22-47181
Address:
Anne O Sullivan,
Brittas,
Glantane,
Mallow,
Co. Cork,
Ireland.

Call by if in the area & tell her I was watching her under a 
microscope.


Tell the boyfriend I'll buy the house if he likes,
pay for the wedding & engagement ring if he likes,
See if I can hook him up with a stripper, I have been subconciously
matchmaking lately & the only close friend I have who I can't
matchmake for is Benjamin Herrenschmidt
he could keep typing with Anne Marie from Tahiti the
biggest bitch I know slapping him in the face fucking him at the same
time & drinking Jack Daniels & coke.

When that fucker starts going the women had better be watching.

Thanks for all your help,
D.J.

Linus'es karate secret, his wife & why linux got so big.

Want to know what you hole in the heads are doing in front of the 
computer.
You are testing your metal, men without self confidence are 
subconciously the bravest.

I became a coward.

Jackasses/Gentlemen come out only when needed & are utterly illogical & 
easy to spot,
Hitler never procreated & the only
reason people look at them is to see what the look like.

When ready you know the way to go do karate in the meantime keep 
slapping the salami.

Do karate & you will never be seduced again you will always make the 
best of the situation
& do whatever you blithering well please karateka gain control by 
letting go & clarity of thought.

Strippers are the family advertisers...


Have fun,
D.J.

Hi Otto,
The motivation behind me increasing my fee every week you don't hire me
is to speed up your decision. Being honest I miss Germany & would do a 
good job for you and Segher should you hire me back. Segher 
underestimates
my ability as I was not motivated when doing the setjmp & longjmp stuff 
&
took longer than expected.

I have another interview on Friday for a contract near home in Cork.
That failing I have another job possibility in Cambridge. If you are
wise you will hire me back quickly.

Alex knows I am good to deliver especially when motivated.

Segher is a loner & likes to work alone.
I'd bet Segher still doesn't put his code/pavlof into a CVS repository 
or similar, has
a backup strategy known to nobody except himself & if he
gets sick you will not even be able to find his code & nobody will be
able to continue with the project because you have nobody who knows the
code except Segher. Otto You are lucky you haven't been caught by this
management mistake.


Otto my resume is good isn't it, the reason it is good is because I am 
good,
& according to Harvey Nash you were intrested in hiring me until you 
figured
out who I was. Accept it you made a mistake letting me go.


am I on drugs ?

The jackass sexmachines was just a subconcious message to give more 
self confidence
& dear god giggle juice.
I am not on drugs just desperate with headfucked sex drive.
I have turned into a new species of male, the matchmaker jackass 
computer nerd looking after
his friends the best he can as fast as he can do it cos they all have 
their head shoved
up their arse in front of the computer screen, I am a karateka a 
co-operator unselfish
not a seducer selfish I am casanova playing the other game.
Don'have t trust any of the girls till they proved their metal.
The girl I'm engaged to hasn't proved any yet so technically we are 
unengaged.


I have no fear & just think moment to moment & cannot plan very much 
just have a priority list.
I suspect they will be more edjits like me emerging from behind the 
computer in a few years
if they start doing karate Segher looks high on the list, he is even 
more headfucked than me.

If you need a white jackass to jump up & down at a meeting with the 
likes of Steve Jobs
& kick him in the balls I'm your man.

Have fun,
D.J.
