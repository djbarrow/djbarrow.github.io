<H2>SEI TECHNICAL CONCEPTS</H2>
<P>The initial Nuclear Thermal Propulsion workshop was intended to identify a 
range of reactor concepts, select Concept Focal Points to specify essential 
concept elements, conduct a mission analysis, identify critical initial tests, 
and provide schedule, milestone, cost and facility requirements estimates. 
<P>These reactor concepts were evaluated according to their ability to meet 
baseline Mars mission requirements, which included use of the 2016 launch window 
for a less than 600 day piloted trip time with a 30 day crew stay on Mars. The 
Mars vehicle would be assembled in LEO, with a 334 kN engine requiring three 
perigee burns for trans-Mars injection with a baseline 124 ton out-bound payload 
and a 40 ton return payload. In the course of the evaluation process, a range of 
variations on this baseline emerged.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> 
<P>Additional mission options identified at the Workshop included an early Mars 
mission in 2006, which would require early propulsion downselect, and a late 
Mars mission in 2026, which would permit a longer technology development 
effort.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> The 
choice of these options results from a balance of various figures of merit, and 
may result in a sequence of missions in which the first Mars mission could be 
slower and less risky, with later Mars missions having shorter trip times, 
building on earlier experience and infrastructure. A number of potential figures 
of merit were discussed at the Workshop:

<P>For the most part, system analyses traded on IMLEO and trip time, because of 
the relative ease of quantifying and calculating these figures of merit. But 
there was a frequently expressed view at the Feedback Workshop that a more 
sophisticated approach was needed, and that other figures of merit might prove 
more informative. It was also recognized that much more work was needed on 
making the case for which figures of merit were most relevant for mission 
analysis, since little work had been done on comparative analysis of figures of 
merit per se. 
<P>A total of 17 propulsion concepts were identified, in four general classes: 
solid core; liquid core; gas core; and other.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> The 
panel recommended that high priority near term technology reactor efforts focus 
on higher temperature fuels, fuel qualification, test facilities, control 
mechanisms, systems lifetime and coatings and coatings design criteria. 
Recommendations for near term propulsion efforts included high temperature 
Hydrogen and neutron compatible materials, nozzle cooling, radiation hardened 
feed systems, Hydrogen kinetics, and system reliability, redundancy and 
operability. Each of the reactor classes was thought to offer a 10-15% 
performance growth potential through technology advances. 
<P>Solid core concepts encompass the widest range of systems, with ten 
configurations identified (nine at the initial workshop, and a tenth, the 
tungsten-water-moderated, identified subsequent to the initial workshop). These 
fall into three categories, including homogeneous thermal reactors in which the 
fuel is mixed with a carbon or beryllium oxide moderator, heterogeneous thermal 
reactors with separate fuel and moderator, and fast reactors with refractory 
materials such as tungsten for structures. The size of these reactors is 
dependent on the efficiency of heat transfer, and performance of these systems 
is a function of the maximum fuel temperature, which is limited to between 2300 
K and 3500 K. Major design considerations include selection of materials to 
avoid hot corrosion with multiple reactor restarts, and fuel element fabrication 
to retain fission products. 
<P>
<CENTER><U><STRONG>Figure III-3 - Nuclear Thermal Propulsion 
Concepts</STRONG></U></CENTER>
<P>Two liquid core reactors were identified, with operating temperatures in the 
range of 3000 K to 9000 K. Major technical uncertainties include the 
effectiveness of heat transfer from the reactor to the propellant, as well as 
the risk of significant fuel droplet loss through the nozzle. A third class of 
reactors includes three gaseous core reactor concepts, which, with core 
temperatures of 9000 K to 15,000 K or higher offer, the highest performance 
levels. But major questions remain concerning plasma containment for these 
concepts. A final category included architectures which called for use of 
in-situ propellant production, or a dual-mode nuclear-thermal / nuclear-electric 
system. 
<P><STRONG><U>1 - NERVA-Derivative Reactor </U></STRONG>
<P>Westinghouse is the leading proponent of the NERVA Derivative Reactor (NDR), 
which has been evaluated for SDI<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> and 
SEI electric propulsion<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> and 
nuclear thermal rocket applications. 
<P>Principal advantages of the NERVA-Derived system are: 
<P>+ An established technology base which has been demonstrated over a wide 
range of thrust capabilities that requires no technical breakthroughs and has 
modest development requirements and risks. 
<P>+ Identified solutions to safety and environment concerns. Loss of coolant 
accidents result in reactor shut-down, since the hydrogen propellant makes a 
significant contribution to core reactivity. 
<P>+ Proliferation resistant nuclear fuel, since highly dispersed low inventory 
discourages diversion, and recovery from TRISO-type beads is a difficult 
process.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> 
<P>Major technical issues include: 
<P>- Demonstration of the effectiveness and lifetime of the ZrC "Super Coat" 
fuel element coating, which received limited testing in the Nuclear Furnace 
program. 
<P>- Safety issues include concerns about fission product exhaust during ground 
testing, reassurance that intact reentry will not lead to reactor critical or 
super-critical geometry if the full core is immersed in water, permanent 
shutdown capabilities using safety rods and control drums, and fuel integrity, 
as well as public perceptions of these issues. 
<P>Near-term Phase I efforts in years 2 through 5 of the program will include: 
<P>* Fuel element tests to demonstrate ZrC coating lifetime and effectiveness; 
<P>* Demonstration of complete fuel element fabrication; 
<P>* Evaluation of reactor safety issues, and demonstration of reactor shutdown. 

<P>Mid-term Phase II research in years 4 through 6 of the program include: 
<P>* System control and prototype flight system control tests; 
<P>* Shielding tests; 
<P>* Safety tests; 
<P>Far-term Phase III activities beginning in year 8 of the program include: 
<P>* Cold flow engine experiments; 
<P>* Hot tests demonstrating operating envelopes; 
<P>* Demonstration of start-up, shut-down, cool-down and emergency responses; 
<P>* Verification of endurance and cycle capabilities. 
<P>Parameters for NERVA, the current NERVA-Derived Reactor (NDR), as well as 
more advanced NERVA-derived systems include:<A

<P>Options for integrated test facilities include exhausting hydrogen into a 
cleanup-scrubber system, or into an underground tunnel, or testing in space. 
Existing containment facilities are argued to be adequate, with modification of 
the hydrogen cleanup system. 
<P>Total costs for the program are estimated at $755 million, including: 
<P>Reactor design &amp; development $ 350 million 
<P>Engine design &amp; development $ 150 million 
<P>Full test procurement &amp; assembly $ 100 million 
<P>Facility preparation $ 125 million 
<P>Tests costs $ 30 million 
<P>Rockwell was responsible for the non-nuclear engine components of the NERVA 
program in the 1960s. Rejoining the NERVA industrial team of the 1960s, 
Westinghouse and Rockwell recently signed a memorandum of understanding 
concerning their joint work on NERVA-Derived Reactors for the Space Exploration 
Initiative -- as with the initial program, Westinghouse will concentrate on 
nuclear systems, with Rockwell focusing on rocket engineering.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> 
<P>Rockwell mission analysis studies have focused on NERVA applications to both 
the Moon and Mars missions.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> For 
the reference 2015 mission, which envisions a total trip time of 565 days, four 
alternatives were considered: Chemical + Aerobrake; Nuclear Thermal with 
engine-out capability; Nuclear thermal with propulsive capture: and Nuclear 
Thermal + Aerobrake. The resulting IMLEO requirements clearly favor nuclear 
thermal: 
<P><U>SYSTEM IMLEO</U> (tons) 
<P>Chemical + Aerobrake 720 
<P>Nuclear Thermal with engine-out 680 
<P>Nuclear Thermal with propulsive capture 580 
<P>Nuclear Thermal + Aerobrake. 340 
<P>A range of mission benefits were identified, including: 
<P>+ Significant trip-time reductions, and broadening of launch and stay-time 
windows, including the potential to conduct single window missions. 
<P>+ Higher specific impulse significantly reduces IMLEO. 
<P>+ Shorter trip-times reduce mass of expendable and shielding, further 
reducing IMLEO. 
<P>Future studies include consideration of hot engines in Mars orbit, as well as 
safeing of reactors returned to Earth orbit. 
<P>Rockwell has also given consideration to improvements in rocket engine 
technology applicable to new NERVA-Derived systems.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> One 
of the primary innovations is the use of an extendible rocket nozzle skirt, to 
significantly increase the nozzle expansion ratio. The basic hydrogen-cooled 
section of the nozzle might extend to an expansion ratio of from 65 if 
carbon-carbon is used for the extendible skirt, or to 150 if a refractory metal 
is used. Significant fabrication problems could limit the use of carbon-carbon, 
which would require a skirt nearly 13 meters long and over 7.5 meters in 
diameter. In addition, the work of Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division on the Space 
Shuttle Main Engine in the 1970s significantly advanced the state of the art:

<P>NASA Lewis has been a leading actor in recovering the engineering heritage of 
the NERVA reactor program. Applications studied include both Lunar Base and Mars 
Expedition missions, with emphasis on modular systems that will support 
evolution from the Lunar to Mars applications. 
<P>Consideration has also been given to NERVA testing requirements, leading to 
recommendations for construction of a 
<P>"... Nuclear Test Facility (NTF) where the integrated system level tests will 
be conducted. Candidate DOE sites include the Nuclear Rocket Development Station 
(NRDS) at Jackass Flats, Nevada, or the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory 
(INEL)...Tests to be conducted include Cold Flow Tests, Startup Transients, 
Ramps to Intermediate Hold Points, Full Power Operation, Shutdown, and Cooldown. 
Engine Exhaust is contained and processed within an effluent treatment system 
which directs hydrogen away from the engine system, removes fission products and 
disposes of the hydrogen in a safe manner... 
<P>"A containment option for consideration is to exhaust the engine into a large 
underground tunnel. Such tunnels are routinely constructed at the Nevada Test 
Site for containment of nuclear weapons test (several tunnels already exist 
within a mile or two from NRDS). Tunnels can be evacuated and used to collect 
the engine effluent. (Benefits include) flexible effluent scrubbing time 
(cleanup of exhaust gases can proceed at slower rates (lower mass flows) than 
the engine exhaust mass flow rate); no environmental contamination in the event 
of operational accident; and test approval not function of weather 
conditions."<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> 
<P>NASA Lewis envisions a three-phase development effort for the NERVA-Derived 
Reactor: 
<P>Phase Activity Period Cost 
<P>1 System Development &amp; Planning 1991-1995 $ 350 M 
<P>2 Electric &amp; Nuclear Furnace tests 1996-2000 $1,450 M 
<P>3 Reactor &amp; Engine System tests 2001-2006 $1,200 M 
<P>TOTAL 15 years $3,000 M 
<P>According to Stanley Borowski of NASA Lewis, much of the engineering heritage 
of the NERVA program could be recaptured within 8 years, leading to an NTR 
flight test as soon as 2002: 
<P>"The punch line is that nuclear propulsion is an enabling technology for the 
moon and Mars. Missions can be seen that demand nuclear electric as well as 
nuclear thermal, but budgets will obviously be the dictating force."<A

<P><STRONG><U>2 - Particle Bed Reactors</U></STRONG> 
<P>In response to SEI propulsion requirements, two design philosophies have been 
suggested,<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> one 
which maximizes the reactor's thrust-to-weight ratio and requires a high power 
density, pressure and temperature, as well as small size and high thrust, and 
another which maximizes specific impulse requires low power density and 
pressure, with very high temperatures, large size and low thrust.

<P>To resolve the range of development issues posed by the Particle Bed Reactor, 
total developmental cost for this concept was estimated at about $1.5 billion 
from 1990 to 2012. This included $320 million through 2000 for an Element Test 
Reactor, $500 million from 1995 to 2008 for a Ground Test Engine (which would 
require an altitude chamber for start-up testing), and $600 million from 2007 
through 2012 for space qualification testing.

<P>The PLUTO-derivative reactor, prevoiusly discussed in the chapter on SDI 
power systems, has also been considered for SEI propulsion applications. The 
applicability of the PLUTO reactor to nuclear thermal propulsion is limited by a 
U<SUB>O2</SUB> BeO fuel phase transition near 1900 K and a low-temperature 
eutectic slightly above 2000 K. These effectively eliminate the PLUTO reactor

<P>General Electric (GE) is the leading proponent for the Cermet Reactor, which 
has been evaluated for SDI<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> and 
SEI applications.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A> A 
range of advantages of the cermet reactor have been suggested: 
<P>+ Cermet reactors offer improved thermal conductivity compared to metal oxide 
fuel elements. 
<P>+ An extensive fuel test engineering heritage exists from the ANP and 710 
programs. 
<P>+ A principle advantage of the Cermet reactor, which was the basis for 
interest in the technology for aircraft propulsion, is the high retention of 
fission products in the fuel matrix. This was experimentally demonstrated in the 
710 Program, in which most test fuel elements demonstrated fission gas fraction 
release of less than 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, while some fuel elements released fission 
fragment fractions in the range of 10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-4</SUP>. This 
should produce less stringent containment and confinement restrictions on Ground 
Test Facilities. 
<P>+ It has also been suggested that the cermet fuel may offer improved swelling 
behavior, but this remains uncertain. 
<P>Several issues remain open: 
<P>- Due to their lower fuel density relative to metal fuel elements, a 
potential disadvantage of cermet fuels is large core size, and thus greater core 
and shielding mass. 
<P>- In order to improve weldability, Rhenium is a potential Cermet cladding 
material.

<P><STRONG><U>8 - Advanced Dumbo</U></STRONG> 
<P>Los Alamos is the Concept Focal Point for the Advanced Dumbo Reactor, based 
on the Dumbo Reactor concept originally developed in the late 1950s.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> The 
Dumbo configuration consists of a number of vertical columns, composed of 
washer-shaped fuel elements separated by spiders to facilitate propellant flow. 
Hydrogen propellant is injected from the exterior of the column, and flows 
axially down the hollow center of the column. Work on Dumbo was cancelled in 
September 1959, based on the conclusion that the design offered no performance 
advantages relative to the graphite core KIWI reactor, and the Dumbo involved a 
more complex design which required a significant number of precision parts. 
<P>The Advanced Dumbo configuration incorporates several innovations. One of the 
major changes from the original 1959 concept is replacing the Cermet fuel with 
UC-ZrC fuel elements. In addition, several variations on the precise fuel 
configuration are under consideration. 
<P>Advantages of this configuration include: 
<P>+ An alternative, radially self-supporting, geometry for UC-ZrC fuel which 
offers reduced thermal stress, and potentially eased fuel fabrication. 
<P>+ Improved efficiency due to increased fuel surface area (intermediate 
between Rover and Particle Bed reactors) with greater fuel flow area (much 
greater than Rover, and greater than Particle Bed). 
<P>
<P>Drawbacks include engineering complexity, fuel fabrication and thermal 
stress, and axial structural support.

<P>Sandia is the Concept Focal Point for the Fission Fragment Assisted Foil 
Reactor,<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A> and 
the Direct Heating Reactor. In the Foil Reactor, a thin 2 micron Uranium layer 
is supported on a Be or Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> substrate, and escaping 
fission fragments directly heat the hydrogen propellant. Concentric fuel plates 
are separated by alternating layers of coolant channels for substrate cooling 
and propellant exhaust. 
<P>The concept was first developed by Bussard and DeLauer in 1958, and was used 
in nuclear pumped laser tests in the FALCON program in the 1980s. The FALCON 
tests verified the relationship between UO<SUB>2</SUB> foil thickness and 
fission fragment energy, demonstrated metallic and ceramic substrates, and 
resulted in gas heating significantly in excess of the 1,500 K substrate 
temperature. About 100 of fuel modules would be clustered into a reactor with

<P>The principle advantages of the Foil reactor concept are: 
<P>+ High thrust and power levels with attractive specific impulse. 
<P>+ Structural elements are much cooler than the propellant, and elevated 
temperatures are confined to small areas. This permits a significant range of 
choice of moderator (D<SUB>2</SUB>O, Be, D<SUB>2</SUB> liquid or gas, 
CD<SUB>4</SUB>) 
<P>+ Safety is enhanced through redundancy of fuel modules, as well as the low 
power density which leads to graceful failure modes and reduces the rate at 
which a core accident progresses. 
<P>+ Fission fragments discharged in propellant flow and short burn times (less 
than 30 minutes) reduce residual radiation hazards. 
<P>Unresolved issues include: 
<P>- Impact of large dilute configuration on criticality and structural design. 
This results in large size and significant reflector cooling mass penalty. 
<P>- Materials issues, including fuel integrity in the face of hydrogen erosion

porous ceramic fabrication. 
<P>- Discharge of fission fragment in propellant flow could significantly 
complicate ground testing (although this could be mitigated by overcoating all 
but one of the modules in the ground test to prevent fission fragment escape, 
and using an open loop scrubber for the one uncoated module).

Mw.<A

system provides a relatively high 930 second specific impulse. 
<P><STRONG><U>13 - Low Pressure Nuclear Thermal Rocket</U></STRONG> 
<P>INEL is the leading proponent of the Low Pressure Nuclear Thermal Rocket 
concept, which was originated by Carl Leyse.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_21_"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A> 
Pressure-fed nuclear reactors were considered in the early 1960s, but the 
conventional graphite core reactors of that period operated at such high core 
pressures as to render the concept impractical. But in the late 1960s a 
preliminary study by Leyse of a low-pressure ( 345 kPa ) NERVA-derived reactor 
identified a number of operational advantages, including improved performance 
and reliability. 
<P>More recently, studies at INEL have focused on using more advanced 
high-temperature ZrC/UC particle or pebble fuel elements, and carbide (such as 
TaC/ZrC/UC or TaC/ZrC) reactor materials. These materials are anticipated to 
permit total operating endurance of over ten hours at 3,000 K, and over two 
hours at 3,200 K, in contrast to the 2,300 K to 2,500 K operating endurance 
range for conventional Graphite matrix fuels. In initial inward-radial-flow 
configurations, the reactor pressure vessel is at the cold end of the propellant 
flow, placing the core in compression, permitting higher chamber temperatures 
and thus specific impulse. More recent designs have focused on 
outward-radial-flow configurations. 
<P>The Low Pressure reactor takes advantage of the disassociation of molecular 
H2 to monatomic hydrogen, with significant increases in specific impulse being 
achieved with chamber pressures below 1.0 MPa (10 atmospheres), and chamber 
temperatures above 3,000 K. The Low Pressure Reactor relies on conventional 
propellant tanks pressure, in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 MPa (2-3 atmospheres) to 
expel the LH2 propellant into the reactor without the need for turbopump 
machinery. 
<P>Some typical reactor characteristics include: 
<P>Thrust kN 22.2 111.2 111.2 48.9 48.9 
<P>Chamber Pressure kPa 69 69 69 103 103

<P>Reactor Power Mwt 500 500 260 260 
<P>Fuel loading U-235 Kg 70 80 50 70 
<P>Proponents claim a number of advantages for the Low Pressure Reactor: 
<P>+ the LP reactor, currently at Technology Readiness Level 2, has a 
development status intermediate between that of the NERVA and more exotic 
concepts such as the gas core; 
<P>+ the LP reactor has a theoretical specific impulse up to 50% higher than 
NERVA, ranging from 1050 to 1350 seconds; 
<P>+ the lower operating pressure can reduce reactor thermal problems, with 
improved core heat transfer and lower nozzle heat flux; 
<P>+ the pressure-fed reactor eliminates the control drums, engine gimbal and 
complicated turbopump machinery of other solid-core reactor concepts, as well as 
reducing the number of valves and reactor parts; 
<P>+ this greatly simplified propellant feed system of the LP reactor could 
provide a significantly more reliable propulsion system than either the NERVA or 
gas core reactors, since the turbopump accounted for about half of the failure 
budget of NERVA; 
<P>+ the simpler propellant feed system also could prove much easier to qualify 
for manned missions, given the absence of complex redundancies typical of NERVA 
systems; 
<P>+ the much lower thrust levels typical of LP reactors (one to two orders of 
magnitude lower than typical of NERVA systems) could result in substantially 
smaller, and thus less expensive, ground test facilities; 
<P>+ clusters of engines (such as seven) would permit two-engine-out abort 
modes; 
<P>However, several issues remain unresolved: 
<P>- the extent to which theoretical molecular hydrogen disassociation and 
recombination specific impulse gains can contribute to actual engine performance 
requires experimental verification, as well as the linearity of the relationship 
between chamber pressure and specific impulse - some analyses suggest major 
gains in specific impulse can be achieved at 100 kPa chamber pressures, while 
others suggest that relatively modest improvements might be achieved even with 
significantly lower chamber pressures; 
<P>- the high temperature HfC and TaC materials needed to realize the higher 
range of specific impulses predicted for this concept are beyond the current 
state of the art, and pose significant development challenges; 
<P>- the ground test facility will require a long (30 meter) low pressure 
blow-down chamber to simulate the space environment for reactor testing, with 
duct diameters 2 to 5 times as large as for conventional NERVA reactors, as well 
as very low pressure drop effluent handling systems with multi-stage ejectors, 
which may demonstrate very poor (5% -10%) efficiencies; 
<P>- the relatively low thrust of this concept would make it difficult to avoid 
using multiple periapsis trans-Mars injection burns, which poses radiation and 
operational safety hazards that can be avoided by higher thrust single-burn 
systems. 
<P>Assuming program initiation in 1991, INEL estimates that a LP reactor 
development program would include the following major milestones: 
<P>1991 - 1994 Environmental Impact Statement 
<P>1991 - 1996 Laboratory development of fuel elements 
<P>1996 - 2000 Nuclear Furnace testing of fuel elements

<P>1996 - 2002 Engine design and component tests 
<P>1999 - 2004 Engine tests 
<P>2001 - 2003 Inert engine flight tests 
<P>2003 - 2006 Live engine flight tests 
<P>Total program costs in the initial four years of the program were estimated 
at nearly $200 million, peaking at $125 million in 1994, including $7 million 
for the EIS, $57 for a test reactor, and $78 million for Nuclear Furnace 
testing. Total program cost from 1991 through 2006 was estimated at slightly 
more than $4 billion, with typical annual budget requirements from 1996 to 2005 
of $300 million, peaking at nearly $500 million in 2000. Nuclear furnace testing 
would require $565 million, twelve engines for ground tests $2,255 million, and 
three flight engines $150 million.

System (LARS).<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_22_"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A> In 
this concept, hydrogen propellant passes through the center of the reactor core 
and is heated as it passes over a surface molten Uranium, which is maintained in 
a liquid annulus on a substrate of solid uranium supported by a rotating Be 
moderator, which is in turn supported by a stationary moderator. Notional 
reactor parameters include:

<P>Reactor mass kg 3,000 3000 
<P>Mass of UC<SUB>2</SUB> kg 30.0 30.0 
<P>Several advantages have been asserted for LARS: 
<P>+ A high specific impulse, in the range of 1500 to 2000 seconds, since the 
operating temperature is not constrained by the melting point of the fuel, which 
permits additional impulse gain due to molecular hydrogen disassociation. 
<P>+ Enhanced reliability due to operation of moderator, control and structural 
components at propellant inlet temperature. 
<P>+ Fission products evaporate directly into the exhaust stream, reducing 
fission product inventory, which reduces post-operation radiation hazard and 
after heat coolant requirements. 
<P>However, a number of limitations have also been identified: 
<P>- Longer burn-times and multiple engines will be required due to low thrust 
levels. 
<P>- Significant development effort will be required due to immature technology 
base. Since this effort would be comparable to that required for higher 
performance gas-core reactors, this concept has not been recommended for further 
work. 
<P>Although little developmental work has been conducted on the LARS concept, a 
proof-of-principle experiment conducted in 1963 demonstrated rotational 
containment of liquid refractories by a cooled solid outer layer using an 
aluminum cylinder. Overall costs of a development program are estimated at $1.6

<P><STRONG><U>15 - Droplet Core Reactor</U></STRONG> 
<P>University of Florida Innovative Nuclear Space Power Institute (INSPI) is 
also the Concept Focal Point for the Droplet Core Reactor.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_23_"><SUP>(23)</SUP></A> This 
concept is the culmination of an evolutionary process that began with the 
Colloid Core concept initially identified in 1970. The Colloid Core used a 
vortex flow cavity to confine U-C-Zr particles in a compact core with a 
temperature of 3,700 K providing a specific impulse of 1100 seconds. Although 
the vortex properties of the core were experimentally simulated in 1972, this 
concept demonstrated very high Uranium particle loss rates. The Rotating Liquid 
Core reactor concept, identified in 1972, used a liquid UC-ZrC fuel contained by 
7,000 RPM centrifugal force, with pressurized hydrogen bubbling through the fuel 
to produce a specific impulse of 1,500 seconds at a temperature of 4,800 K. 
Deficiencies of this concept included high fuel loss rates, as well as the 
absence of a reliable rotation mechanism for the liquid fuel. 
<P>The Droplet Core reactor concept, first identified in 1988, is applicable to 
both nuclear thermal propulsion and space electric power generation.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_24_"><SUP>(24)</SUP></A> This 
reactor recirculates a liquid Uranium fuel maintained in a stable liquid phase, 
which at a pressure of 500 atmospheres runs from 1,400 K to 9,500 K. Uranium 
droplets vary in size from 2 to 20 microns, depending on hydrogen flow velocity, 
which can range from 200 to 2,500 m/sec. Tangential injection of hydrogen 
propellant maintains the vortex flow of the fuel and propellant mixture, 
protecting the reactor wall from excess heating. Entrainment of fuel droplets 
could minimize fuel loss to as little as 50 kg per mission. This configuration 
can provide thrust in the range from 11 kN to 1,800 kN, with a specific impulse 
ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 seconds.

<P>U<SUP>2</SUP> recirculation rate kg/sec 70 70 - 1,000 
<P>A number of advantages are associated with this concept: 
<P>+ The excellent mixing of fuel and propellant provides extremely high surface 
area density (over 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUP>2</SUP>/M<SUP>3</SUP>), a thousand-fold 
improvement over solid-core concepts. This results in the deposition of about 
50% of the fission energy into the propellant flow, which is heated to 3,000 K 
to 7,000 K, 
<P>+ Specific impulse is improved by the high level of non-equilibrium 
disassociation of hydrogen molecules by fission fragments, which can approach 
20% at 6,000 K. 
<P>+ These high operating temperatures produce a specific impulse greater than 
2,000 seconds (at 6,000 K), and high thrust-to-weight ratios (unshielded T/W 
ratio of 5 for a 333 kN rocket, 1.6 with shielding). This can reduce Mars 
mission trip-times to less than 200 days. 
<P>+ Engine thrust is limited by nozzle cooling capability, and can be throttled 
by varying the propellant flow rate (a reactor producing 111 kN at 7 kg/sec will 
produce 666 kN at 33 kg/sec). 
<P>+ Safety features include: in-orbit fueling to avoid launch accident 
criticality hazards; low residual radioactivity due to expulsion of all gaseous 
and some non-gaseous fission products in the propellant stream during 
operations; and low Uranium U-233 loading (20 kg in core and 100-150 kg total). 
<P>+ Mechanical simplicity improves reliability. 
<P>Several problems have been identified with this concept: 
<P>- The Liquid Droplet Core is highly dependent on the development of new 
materials with acceptable mechanical and thermal properties at ultra-high 
temperatures. These materials include single crystal tantalum and tungsten, 
low-porosity glossy carbon, W-Re-HfC alloys, and E-ThO<SUB>2</SUB> alloys. 
<P>- Neutron activation of W and Ta structural materials will produce high 
levels of radiation. 
<P>- Significant uncertainties associated with the performance of the liquid 
fuel recirculation system. 
<P>- Liquid fuel reactors appear to offer inferior performance relative to 
gas-core concepts, while requiring similar development efforts.

Core Reactor configuration.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_26_"><SUP>(26)</SUP></A> 
<P>The Nuclear Light Bulb marks a departure from other Gas Core reactor 
concepts, in which the Uranium vapor is in physical contact with the Hydrogen 
propellant. Instead, in the Light Bulb, the Uranium gas is confined in a 
cylinder of fused silica by a tangential vortex of buffer gas, which like the 
fused silica is transparent to radiation. The hydrogen propellant flows outside 
this cylinder, and is heated by injection of micron-size tungsten particles 
which absorb the thermal radiation from the hot fuel. 
<P>Principle advantages of this system are: 
<P>+ Significant reductions in triptime and IMLEO, with round trips to Mars 
typically requiring less than one year. 
<P>+ Fuel is contained, avoiding fuel loss of other Gas Core concepts. 
<P>+ In contrast to open core cycles, which analysis has suggested have 
significant stability control problems, Nuclear Light Bulb core stability can be 
maintained by varying fuel injection rates. Power oscillations either quickly 
damp, or oscillate with long periods within acceptable limits. 
<P>+ The reactor is designed for reuse, since the fuel is stored separately. 
<P>Outstanding technical issues include: 
<P>- Reactor and system stability over the full range of operating conditions. 
<P>- Failure modes and safety impacts, and overall system reliability. 
<P>- Fuel and buffer gas separation, and recirculation system performance. 
<P>- UF<SUB>4</SUB> deposition on confinement wall interiors can reduce 
transparency, although this can be mitigated by addition of small amounts of 
fluorine to the buffer gas. 
<P>- A significant fraction (over 10%) of the gas core heat output is at 
ultraviolet wavelengths at which the fused silica confinement wall is opaque. 
Unacceptable wall thermal loading would result, unless the buffer gas is seeded 
with silicon. 
<P>- Environmental impacts of Earth Development Facility.

Initial studies in the 1960's concluded that Open Cycle Gas Core Reactors with 
8,500 MWt power and a thrust of 222 kN had the potential to conduct piloted Mars

vehicle IMLEO of 1,200 tons, and round trip missions of 250 days could be

in an annulus in the center of the core by tangential injection of hydrogen 
propellant from the walls of the core, with the central region of the Uranium 
vapor annulus dominated by hydrogen propellant, which exits the rear of the 
reactor at temperatures of 6,000 K to 8,000 K. 
<P>A rotary fluid separator collects the Uranium, which is subsequently cooled 
in a heat exchanger and recirculated for injection at the forward end of the 
reactor. The power levels of these engines scale directly with propellant mass 
flow rates. Reactor control is maintained by fuel density variation rather than 
with control rods or drums.

<P>In addition to those advantages of the Vapor Core reactor previously noted in 
the chapter on SDI power applications, attractive features specifically related 
to SEI include: 
<P>+ Very high fuel and propellant operating temperatures, limited by wall 
cooling capabilities rather than fuel temperatures, and thus high specific 
impulse. This translates reductions of more than 30% in Mars mission trip times, 
as well as lower IMLEO. 
<P>+ Efficient energy transfer from fuel to propellant by direct molecular 
collision, radiative heat, and direct fission fragment deposition. 
<P>+ Since the reactors are launched unfueled, there is no possibility of 
criticality due to launch accident. 
<P>As discussed in the chapter on SDI power applications, however, a number of 
very serious technical challenges are associated with the Vapor Core reactor. 
<P>Major test facilities to resolve these issues include: 
<P>1991-93 - Non-critical UF<SUB>4</SUB> fueled mini-cavities tested at high 
temperatures without a neutron flux, and at lower temperatures with neutron 
flux. Tests could be conducted at the Fast Flux Test Reactor, as well as the 
UTREC (Ultrahigh Temperature Reactor and Energy Conversion), EBR II and HFIR 
(High Flux Irradiation Reactor) facilities. These tests will require a total of 
$8 million. 
<P>1993-95 - Low power (20-100 kwt) low temperature (500K), UF<SUB>6</SUB> 
fueled flowing critical facility without coolant, at the LANL Plasma Core Cavity 
Reactor. 
<P>1994-98 - A new Facility to conduct mid-power (0.1-1.0 Mwt) mid-temperature 
(1000 K) criticality and reactivity feedback and power density tests, with 
Helium cooled UF<SUB>4</SUB> core with cavity and internal moderator. The total 
cost of this and related efforts to determine engineering feasibility is 
estimated to be about $90 million. 
<P>1998-200? - A new Facility to conduct an integral demonstration experiment at 
high power (5 Mwt) high-temperature (2500 K) criticality and reactivity feedback 
and power density tests, with H<SUB>2</SUB> cooled slip-stream recirculation 
UF<SUB>4</SUB> core with internal moderation. This will require annual funding 
of about $40 million per year. 
<P>Work in the Nuclear Engineering Program at the University of Missouri has 
include investigation of the stability of Gas Core Reactors.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_30_"><SUP>(30)</SUP></A> In 
response to a NASA Lewis workshop in the summer of 1988, a study was undertaken 
of the stability of Gas Core Reactors. In the past, 
<P>"the relatively long prompt neutron lifetime (6 milliseconds) of this reactor 
system, with its heavy water reflector, led to the belief that the system could 
always be controlled by fast acting control system actuators." 
<P>The subject of this analysis was a notional reactor with the following 
parameters: 
<P>Parameter Unit value 
<P>Reactor Power MWt 36,577 
<P>Engine Thrust kN 1,880 
<P>Cavity pressure atmospheres 300 
<P>Cavity internal radius cm 183 
<P>U-235 fuel ball radius cm 74 
<P>Hydrogen flow rate kg/sec 71.2 
<P>Specific Impulse seconds 2,697 
<P>Fuel edge temperature K 17,760 
<P>Fuel center temperature K 131,600 
<P>The study noted that: 
<P>"The fuel mass is the most difficult parameter to control. Small, but rather 
rapid, changes in fuel mass can be expected because of the turbulent mixing of 
the propellant and fuel. The flowing gas containment experiments had shown that 
volume flow rate ratios of the outer to inner gas in the range of 100 to 1 can 
be achieved, with a central fuel ball size 40% of the cavity volume. This gives 
an effective fuel mass replacement in approximately 250 seconds... Smaller fuel 
volumes gave even better containment rates." 
<P>The results of the study include the observation that: 
<P>"In the case of oscillation in the fuel mass, such as what one might expect 
from the turbulence causing mixing of the hydrogen and uranium, the response was 
found to quickly become exponentially unstable... It is apparent that the 
response is prompt and rapid, to even slight variations in propellant flow 
(which is easily controlled by the operator) or fuel mass (which the operator 
has virtually no control over, or even a method of observing). These effects are 
well into the "prompt critical" range of the system, in which the delayed 
neutrons have little influence. The response to the asymmetrical oscillation of 
fuel mass was somewhat surprising... The unstable positive effect on reactivity 
and power over two cycles indicates the inherent instability of the system. It 
is also interesting to note that, as the negative swing is made just slightly 
greater in magnitude, the power oscillations change from increasing instability 
to appear more stable, or unstable in the negative direction, i.e. toward 
shutting down the reactor. This leads one to the conclusion that with fast 
response control actuators, conditions of quasi-inherent stability should be 
attainable." 
<P>The study also noted that: 
<P>"These results are a qualitative evaluation of the system's stability. 
Additional details and refinements may reduce the magnitude of the inherent 
instability, bur one would not expect that such refinements would reverse the 
system stability (i.e. make it inherently stable)." 
<P><STRONG><U>19 - Dual Mode</U></STRONG> 
<P>One of Sandia's major contributions to the nuclear propulsion field was a 
wide-ranging review of gas-cooled reactor concepts for SDI multi-megawatt 
burst-mode and steady state power production applications.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_31_"><SUP>(31)</SUP></A> This 
review was focused on power production rather than nuclear thermal propulsion, 
and the study noted that the "conclusions reached in this study are limited to 
the applications discussed... (and) the rank order of the basic concepts may be 
radically different for other power ranges, operating times and missions." 
Nonetheless, many of the reactor concepts considered and the associated 
technical issues are common to both applications. 
<P>The growing interest in dual mode nuclear propulsion concepts (in which the 
reactor is initially operated for thermal propulsion for injection into and 
braking from trans-Mars and trans-Earth trajectories, then operates at lower 
power to produce electrical power following injection and prior to capture) 
increases the relevance of Sandia's work. However, the study did not directly 
address bi-modal reactors "because the merits of bi-modal reactors are not 
conclusive, and because many combinations of power level and operating times 
could be considered." The study also noted "the complexity associated with mode 
switching and the potential for fuel damage during mode switching..." for such 
reactors. 
<P>General Electric has also performed studies of hybrid or dual mode propulsion 
systems, which combine low-thrust high specific impulse system such as Nuclear 
Electric Propulsion (NEP) with higher-thrust less efficient systems, such as 
Nuclear Thermal.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_32_"><SUP>(32)</SUP></A> 
Several combinations of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) with other systems have 
been suggested: 
<P>NTP + Chemical Although this combination provides only limited performance 
improvement, it may be needed for short-burn orbital capture maneuvers. 
<P>NTP + NEP or High thrust NTP would be used for Earth escape to avoid the Van 
Allen radiation belts, and low-thrust NEP would be used for the rest of the 
mission. 
<P>NTP + NEP High thrust NTP would be used for Earth escape, and Mars capture 
and escape, with low-thrust NEP would be used the rest of the mission to reduce 
trip-time. 
<P>Battelle Pacific Northwest Lab is the Concept Focal Point for Dual-Mode 
NEP/NTP hybrid propulsion concepts, which have also been examined by General 
Electric.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_33_"><SUP>(33)</SUP></A> The 
PNL concept uses a NERVA reactor for Trans-Mars and Trans-Earth injection, which 
is supplemented by an electric propulsion system. The propulsion system for a 
124 ton payload has a mass of 16 tons, which results in a total IMLEO of 524 
tons. 
<P>Parameter Unit NTP NEP 
<P>Type NERVA MPD

<P>Reactor Power MWe 8 
<P>Specific Impulse seconds 850 5,000 
<P>Thrust kN 334 0.066 
<P>Operating Lifetime 10 hours 2 years 
<P>Advantages of hybrid systems include: 
<P>+ Power requirements for comparable trip-times can be significantly reduced 
relative to pure NEP systems. 
<P>+ For equal power levels trip-times can be significantly reduced. 
<P>+ Improved mission reliability due to redundant systems, including electric 
power production for house-keeping and surface exploration (through power 
beaming), as well as the availability of alternate propulsion means. 
<P>+ The availability of high-thrust at any point in the mission significantly 
increases mission resiliency. 
<P>+ High thrust during Earth escape avoid the Van Allen belt radiation hazard 
(although Solar flare shielding requirements may obviate this benefit). 
<P>The greatest drawback is the need to develop two different propulsion systems 
(NEP and NTP), which significantly increases development cost and risk. 
<P>Total development cost is estimated at $950 million from 1991 through 2003. 
<P>Sverdrup has considered the benefit of hybrid propulsion, under contract to 
NASA Lewis.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_34_"><SUP>(34)</SUP></A> 
<P>"Minimizing trip time exacts a penalty in higher IMEO, conversely, a minimum 
IMEO results in longer trip time. These two conflicting figures of merit, trip 
time and IMEO, correspond to two types of propulsion that are able to minimize 
one or the other, but not both... An alternate solution to the paradox of 
minimizing trip time and IMEO is the concept of a "hybrid" propulsion systems, 
using both high thrust, low Isp and low thrust, high Isp systems to gain the 
advantages of both... The nuclear thermal (NTR) and NEP hybrid also have the 
option of separate propulsion and power reactors or a single reactor used to 
provide energy for both forms of propulsion. By utilizing the two forms of 
propulsion in the proper regimes, reasonable trip times can be achieved with 
less IMEO than either of the two systems separately." 
<P>This analysis also reported conclusions derived from an earlier study of 
hybrid systems, conducted in 1968. This prior study assumed a Mars Mission 
Module mass of 72 tons, and a Mars Excursion Module mass of 179 tons. 
<P>Some representative vehicle figures of merit include: 
<P>
<P>Year Trip IMEO 
<P>Time tons 
<P>Days 
<P>
<P>Chemical (Split Sprint) 2003 440 1754 
<P>NTR Nuclear Thermal 1980 400 2160 
<P>NTR + Nuclear Electric (NEP) 1980 400 1584 
<P>Chemical + NEP 1980 400 2520 
<P>Chemical + NEP 1980 500 1080 
<P>Rockwell has analyzed Nuclear Thermal / Nuclear Electric propulsion systems, 
of the type for which Pacific Northwest Lab is the Concept Focal Point.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_35_"><SUP>(35)</SUP></A> A 
major attraction of such systems is their potential to reduce trip time, and 
thus crew exposure to radiation and weightlessness. 
<P>This analysis considered a system based on: 
<P>Parameter Value NTR NEP 
<P>Type Phoebus MPD 
<P>Power MW 4,000 MWt 1,320 MWe 
<P>Thrust kN 1,125 22 
<P>Specific Impulse seconds 1,000 5,000 
<P>Propellant flow rate kg/sec 113.4 0.454 
<P>This analysis noted that one-way trip times of less than 50 days can be 
implemented with hybrid propulsion systems for total IMLEO of less than 1,200 
tons and payloads of 175 tons.

<P>Martin Marietta is the Concept Focal Point for the Nuclear Indigenous Mars 
Propellent mission scheme.<A 
href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/c07sei_2.htm#N_36_"><SUP>(36)</SUP></A> NIMF 
proposes to drastically reduce IMLEO requirements by refueling a nuclear powered 
Mars Excursion Module on the surface of Mars with propellants derived from the 
Martian environment. Candidate propellants include Carbon Dioxide condensed from 
the atmosphere, Water melted from ice or permafrost, and methane synthesized 
from carbon dioxide using nuclear reactor heating. Used with a nuclear reactor, 
the specific impulse of these propellants range from 280 seconds for carbon 
dioxide, which would only be adequate for reaching Mars orbit, to 350 seconds 
for water, which would be adequate for direct ascent to Trans-Earth injection, 
to 560 seconds for methane, which would permit direct insertion into a 
high-energy Trans-Earth injection orbit (methane production would require 
catalytic reaction with additional hydrogen reactant from Earth). 
<P>Successful operation of this system would require reactor fuel materials or 
coatings capable of resisting corrosion by high temperature carbon dioxide 
(above 2,200 K). The BeO fuel elements developed in the PLUTO program may enable 
operations at temperatures up to 2,400 K. Illustrative mission architectures 
include a scheme under which a single Shuttle-C derived heavy lift booster would 
launch a single 47 ton automated propellant production plant to Mars. Once the 
100 kWe power plant had produced adequate propellant, a subsequent mission would 
emplace the crew on the Martian surface, using the propellant from the first 
mission for the return flight.
