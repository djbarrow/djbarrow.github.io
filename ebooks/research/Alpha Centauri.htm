<H1>Alpha Centauri</H1>
<H2>A Candidate for Terrestrial Planets And Intelligent Life</H2>
<P align=right><I>Last Update 15th October '97 - new update currently in 
preparation</I> 
<HR>
Alpha Centauri is a special star - not only because it is the closest stellar 
system to the sun but also because it is one of the relatively few places in the 
Milky Way Galaxy that may offer terrestrial life conditions. If humanity looks 
for intelligent life elsewhere, then Alpha Centauri is an excellent candidate. 
<P>Visible only from latitudes south of about 25° the star we call Alpha 
Centauri lies 4.35 light-years from the Sun. But it is actually a triple star 
system. The two brightest components Alpha Centauri A and B form a binary. They 
orbit each other in 80 years with a mean separation of 23 astronomical units (1 
astronomical unit = 1 AU = distance between the Sun and Earth). The third member 
of the system Alpha Centauri C lies 13,000 AU from A and B, or 400 times the 
distance between the Sun and Neptune. This is so far that it is not known 
whether Alpha Centauri C is really bound to A and B, or if it will have left the 
system in some million years. Alpha Centauri C lies measurably closer to us than 
the other two: It is only 4.22 light-years away, and it is the nearest 
individual star to the Sun. Because of this proximity, Alpha Centauri C is also 
called Proxima (Centauri).

<P>Alpha Centauri A is a yellow star with a spectral type of G2, exactly the 
same as the Sun's. Therefore its temperature and color also match those of the 
Sun. Alpha Centauri B is an orange star with a spectral type of K1. Whereas 
Alpha Centauri A and B are stars like the Sun, Proxima is a dim red dwarf with a 
spectral type of M5 - much fainter, cooler, and smaller than the Sun. Proxima is 
so faint that astronomers did not discover it until 1915.

<P>Alpha Centauri is a special place, because it may offer life conditions 
similar to our solar system. A star must pass five tests before we can call it a 
promising place for terrestrial life as we know it. Most stars in the Galaxy 
would fail. In the case of Alpha Centauri, however, we see that Alpha Centauri A 
passes all five tests, Alpha Centauri B passes either all but one, and only 
Proxima Centauri flunks out. 
<P>The first criterion is to ensure a star's maturity and stability, which means 
it has to be on the main sequence. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen into helium 
at their cores, generating light and heat. Because hydrogen is so abundant in 
stars, most of them stay on the main sequence a long time, giving life a chance 
to evolve. The Sun and all three components of Alpha Centauri pass this test. 
<P>The second test is much tougher, however, we want the star to have the right 
spectral type, because this determines how much energy a star emits. The hotter 
stars - those with spectral types O, B, A, and early F - are no good because 
they burn out fast and die quickly. The cooler stars - those with spectral types 
M and late K - may not produce enough energy to sustain life, for instance they 
may not permit the existance of liquid water on their planets. Between the stars 
that are too hot and those that are too cool, we find the stars that are just 
right. As our existance proves, yellow G-type stars like the Sun can give rise 
to life. Late (cool) F stars and early (hot) K stars may be fine too. Luckily, 
Alpha Centauri A passes this test with bravour, as it is of the same class as 
our Sun. Alpha Centauri B is a K1 star, so it is hotter and brighter than most K 
stars, therefore it may pass this test or it may not. And the red dwarf Proxima 
Centauri seems to be a hopeless case. 
<P>For the third test, a system must demonstrate stable conditions. The star's 
brightness must not vary so much that the star would alternately freeze and fry 
any life that does manage to develop around it. But because Alpha Centauri A and 
B form a binary pair there's a further issue. How much does the light received 
by the planets of one star vary as the other star revolves around it ? During 
their 80-year orbit, the separation between A and B changes from 11 AU to 35 AU. 
As viewed from the planets of one star, the brightness of the other increases as 
the stars approach and decreases as the stars recede. Fortunately, the variation 
is too small to matter, and Alpha Centauri A and B pass this test. However, 
Proxima fails this test, too. Like many red dwarfs it is a flare star, prone to 
outbursts that cause its light to double or triple in just a few minutes. 
<P>The fourth condition concerns the stars' ages. The Sun is about 4.6 billion 
years old, so on Earth life had enough time to develop. A star must be old 
enough to give life a chance to evolve. Remarkably, Alpha Centauri A and B are 
even older than the Sun, they have an age of 5 to 6 billion years, therefore 
they pass this test with glamour, too. Proxima, however, may be only a billion 
years or so old, then it fails this test, too. 
<P>And the fifth and final test: Do the stars have enough heavy elements - such 
as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron - that biological life needs ? Like most 
stars, the Sun is primarily hydrogen and helium, but 2 percent of the Sun's 
weight is metals. (Astronomers call all elements heavier than helium "metals".) 
Although 2 percent may not sound a lot, it is enough to build rocky planets and 
to give rise to us. And again, fortunately, Alpha Centauri A and B pass this 
test. They are metal-rich stars. 
<P>Now to the final question. Do we find at Alpha Centauri warm, rocky planets 
like Earth, full of liquid water ? Unfortunately, we don't know yet whether 
Alpha Centauri even has planets or not. What we know is that in a binary system 
the planets must not be too far away from a particular star, or else their 
orbits become unstable. If the distance exceeds about one fifth of the closest 
approach of the two stars then the second member of the binary star fatally 
disturbes the orbit of the planet. For the binary Alpha Centauri A and B, their 
closest approach is 11 AU, so the limit for planetary orbits is at about 2 
astronomical units. Comparing with our system, we see that both Alpha Centauri A 
and B might hold four inner planets like we have Mercury (0.4 AU), Venus (0.7 
AU), Earth (1 AU) and Mars (1.5 AU). Therefore, both Alpha Centauri A and B 
might have one or two planets in the life zone where liquid water is possible.

<HR>
One may conclude that Alpha Centauri is a most promising star system regarding 
terrestrial planets and possible life. It is interesting to note what NASA 
administrator <A 
href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/Other_Groups/PAO/html/warp/nasa.htm">Daniel S. 
Goldin</A> declared in 1992: <CITE>"Imagine if spectroscopic analysis revealed a 
blue planet with oxygen atmosphere just 4 light years away orbiting Alpha 
Centaury. The demand to build a <A 
href="http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/groups/relativity/papers/abstracts/miguel94a.html">warp 
drive</A> would start right away!"</CITE> When will we know whether there are 
really planets at Alpha Centauri? Actually, the <A 
href="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/HSToverview.html">Hubble Space Telescope</A> 
is checking for their existance. And it seems to be no coincidence that, 
recently, at an experts meeting in Toledo/Spain, the chief of the NASA research 
program Mike Kaplan stated that <CITE>"...we will discover extraterrestrial life 
in the next 25 years"</CITE>. Thus, it might soon happen that we are able to 
take a look at our cosmic neighbours.
