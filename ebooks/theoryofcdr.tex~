\begin{abstract}
This theory is both spiritual \& scientific,
there is ``God in the gaps''.
In the following few paragraphs using known \& generally
accepted principles \& theories of quantum mechanics \&
one small addition of my own I will come to a few intresting
conclusions.

\maketitle

Just because drugs can induce hallucinations \&
there is an area of the mind devoted to fantasy
doesn't mean to me that hallucinations are ``in the mind'.
I am about to show that everybody in the world may have equal
right to believe their own perspective of reality even the madman.
The madman may just be viewing a different equally physical Universe to
that perceived by sane people.

The role of a conscious observer is of very real importance 
to what we know as reality.
As far as quantum physics is concerned \& to understand it
you need to unlearn all the Newtonian physics you have learned
since you were 3 years old \& re philosophize.

The Schroedinger Cat thought experiment was originally thought up
by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger in 1926 to 
highlight the ridiculousness of quantum physics,
it now is being used as an example to describe how
quantum physics really is.
In the thought experiment a cat is locked into a closed box with a radioactive
substance which ejects a radioactive particle at
random intervals, there is also a radiation detector in the box 
which will detect this radioactive particle if it is ejected,
if a radioactive particle is detected a gun goes
off which kills the cat. The box is soundproof \& all
the walls are opaque so the only way of telling
if the cat is dead is by opening the box.
The rules of quantum physics dictate that the cat is in a
superposition of states, both alive \& dead
until the box is opened \& observed by a conscious
observer, this conscious observer by observing causes
a ``crystallizing of reality'' which
in quantum physics is called the ``collapse of the wave function'.
This superposition of states is the cornerstone to the
``many worlds'' theory.

The strong anthropic principle states that 
the Universe must have those properties which allow life to 
develop within it at some stage in its history.
In other words the a Universe cannot form unless
there are conscious observers to watch it at some
stage in its history.

Whenever a sub atomic event with multiple possible outcomes
occurs all of these outcomes become real and form
a series of parallel Universes that have a separate
existence \& development. Our consciousness
inhabits just one of them, the reality we experience. 
This is the ``many worlds'' theory as initially proposed
by American Physicist Hugh Everett, these many worlds
coexisting is another building block in my argument.

I am now about to give you the most important idea in this argument.
Because the conscious mind is of central importance to what
one perceives as reality, I believe that altering the brain's state 
e.g. by giving the victim drugs, alters the 
reality the victim experiences to one of the other ``many worlds''
different to the one 
experienced by the rest of us who don't 
have our brain state altered, this is somewhat akin
to the victim tuning into a different television channel to
the one that sane people watch. Clarification is needed here,
by consciousness determining reality I mean that
altering the victim's brain state determines the flavour
of the reality being experienced by the victim, 
the victim I believe cannot influence the direction of his
or hers experience by choice.
There are other ways of altering our brain state
besides Drugs e.g. a strong electromagnetic
field may alter the way synapses in the brain fire, a victim
having a brain hormone imbalance \& going mad will cause
the victim to experience an alternate reality.

Altering the brain's state while the victim is alive 
is equivalent to altering the victims conscious state.
We are spiritual beings, God made us flawed ``machines'
completely understandable to ourselves from a science
perspective so we would be able to learn to repair ourselves
except for our consciousness, this is our soul.
Some well known authors have come up with
interesting arguments trying to explain away
consciousness by saying it doesn't exist,
I believe they are wrong.
The brain is only a physical manifestation where
consciousness takes place while the victim is alive.
Doctors may talk about scientific things like brain
hormones \& can find out when we are dreaming by 
measuring brainwaves \& have a basic map of
what part of the brain does what from
measuring brain activity using EEG's \& studying braindamaged
victims, but to be honest they don't have a clue how
brains work, this alteration of brain state has to be
accepted as being spiritual. Science might one day
be able to explain the brain as a consciousless
zombie computer which has neural net algorithms
deciding what to do next, but I wouldn't expect
it anytime soon.

I myself personally believe that God normally only 
crystallizes the reality of one Universe for normal people 
\& then creates others temporarily when observers need 
to witness an alternate Universe, some variant of the anthropic
principle may apply to this alternate Universe.

People witnessing the virgin Mary in Lourdes or similar 
are multiple people seeing the same hallucination,
this is how Mary does her work, like most women
she is chatty \& likes talking to people, nice woman.
Surely Occam's razor should apply here,
the simplest explanation is the most likely,
it is much easier for God to create one
alternate reality for these people to tune into
than give them all ``in the head'' experiences. 
The only difference between these visions \& the hallucination
of a madman's that nobody else witnesses the madman's hallucination
so he has nobody to back him up.

Rarely after a lot of drink people believe they
are being chased by Rats \& attempt to climb walls etc.
to avoid them. This commonly happens to people suffering
from Delirium Tremens DT's. This I think is not
a figment of peoples imagination but a very real experience
in an alternate reality, I believe this is God's way to 
scare the hell out of self destructive drunks to get them
give up drink.

For conscious entities time is just a measure of rhythmic
machine ``ticks'', sometimes it moves fast, sometimes it moves
slow, ``A watched kettle never boils'', in life \& death
situations an altered state of consciousness occurs where
time moves very slowly of victims so 
they get time to react, for some people their entire
life flashes before them in a moment, some people report
only seeing things in black \& white because the brain
doesn't have the time to process colour images.
Large doses of adrenalin causes an altered state
of consciousness which slows down time for the victim.
If slowing down time for conscious beings is possible why not timetravel?,
Some people in who get put into psychiatric hospitals
experience timetravel, these grandiose thoughts can be caused
by a lot of psychotic disorders but are generally caused
by a serotonine \& dopamine hormone imbalance.

God has been providing people with glimpses \& hints
of Heaven at least since man first walked the earth.
Outer body experiences or OBE's 
are usually near death experiences when the 
soul or consciousness temporarily leaves the body
\& floats above it, from this perspective the person
having the OBE can see things which would be impossible
to see if the consciousness remained in the body.
It is caused I believe by a lack of oxygen to the brain.
When the person is brain dead I believe the consciousness 
is fully released from the body \&
allowed to rejoin the cosmic consciousness or
even go to what I believe is Heaven that 
``bright light, happy place'' that some good OBE victims experience.
I'd suspect Heaven is where all the good souls become one \& hell
is where all the bad people get locked up in  isolated from everybody else
\& lost from God.

LSD \& Magic Mushrooms I believe can take drug abusers 
to ``Alice in Wonderland''
alternate realities, these realities can be places where the World
is flat \& the planets are carried around by angels, Galileo I suspect was
only correct about our reality.
