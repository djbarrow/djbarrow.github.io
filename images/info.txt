Fonts:
heading text = Helvetica bold, 37pt. Lilac.
shadow = Helvetica bold, 37pt. Black. Right 1 pixel, Down 2 pixels

Heading images are 360x60. The comet should be aligned to the
right-hand side of
the image (see emptycomet.gif). If text has underhangs ("g/j/p/q/y"),
then make image taller by adding rows at the bottom. (compare
ariaprojectshead.gif with araiabouthead.gif)
Text baseline is at top+50 pixels - this is where the lowest lilac
pixel should be for letters like i,m,n, etc (curved letters may
underhang slightly). Text is aligned at left, with shadow 1 pixel to
right and 2 pixels down.
